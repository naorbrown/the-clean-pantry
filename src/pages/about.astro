      From First Principles
    </h1>

    <div class="prose prose-bark dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Clean Pantry exists because we believe you shouldn't need a chemistry degree
        — or a hazmat suit — to clean your home.
      </p>

      <h2>The philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by the work of <strong>Dr. Lawrence Wilson</strong> and <strong>Dr. Paul Eck</strong>'s
        nutritional balancing approach, we take a <em>first principles</em> view of household products.
        The question isn't "what's the best natural cleaner?" — it's "what's the absolute minimum
        I need, and is it truly safe?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Wilson recommends avoiding all commercial detergents — even those labeled "natural" —
        due to potential liver toxicity. Instead, he advocates for the simplest possible alternatives:
        plain castile soap, white vinegar, and non-toxic abrasives like Bon Ami.
      </p>

      <h2>The core four</h2>
      <p>
        Through our research across dozens of trusted sources, we've found that just
        <strong>four ingredients</strong> handle roughly 90% of household needs:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Water</strong> — the universal solvent</li>
        <li><strong>White vinegar</strong> — disinfects, degreases, and deodorizes (pH 2.0 acetic acid)</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda</strong> — a gentle abrasive that scrubs and absorbs odors</li>
        <li><strong>Castile soap</strong> — a vegetable-based, biodegradable soap for everything else</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Everything beyond these four is an enhancement, not a necessity.
      </p>

      <h2>What we're not</h2>
      <p>
        We're not a store. We don't sell anything. We don't run ads. Every recipe on this site
        is free, tested, and designed to use the fewest, simplest, least expensive ingredients possible.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use this site</h2>
      <p>
        Browse by <a href="/categories/">category</a> to find recipes for specific tasks.
        Visit <a href="/ingredients/">The Pantry</a> to learn about each ingredient —
        what it does, why it works, and how to store it. Every recipe includes safety
        warnings and material compatibility notes so you don't accidentally damage
        a surface.
      </p>

      <h2>A note on safety</h2>
      <p>
        "Natural" doesn't always mean "safe for everything." Vinegar will etch marble.
        Baking soda can scratch delicate surfaces. Borax requires careful handling around
        children and pets. Every recipe on this site includes honest safety information —
        including what surfaces and situations to <em>avoid</em>.
