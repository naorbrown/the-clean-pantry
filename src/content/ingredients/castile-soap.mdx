Castile soap is a plant-based true soap, meaning it is made through saponification (reacting vegetable oils with an alkali) rather than from synthetic detergents. This distinction matters for DIY cleaning because true soap is biodegradable, gentle on skin, and effective at cutting grease without harsh chemicals. A small amount goes a long way — most recipes call for just a teaspoon or two of concentrated castile soap per spray bottle of cleaner.

In DIY formulas, castile soap serves as the primary surfactant — the ingredient that allows water to mix with and lift away oil and dirt. You will find it in all-purpose cleaners, dish soaps, floor cleaners, hand washes, and even laundry detergent recipes. Its versatility is remarkable, but it does have one critical limitation: never mix castile soap directly with vinegar or other acids. The acid reverses the saponification process, breaking the soap back down into its original oils and leaving behind a white, curdled residue. If a recipe calls for both, use them in separate steps — clean with the soap first, rinse, then follow with a vinegar spray.

The most widely available brand is Dr. Bronner's, which comes in both liquid and bar form, and in scented varieties (peppermint, lavender, tea tree) as well as unscented ("Baby Unscented"). For cleaning recipes, unscented is generally the best choice since it gives you control over fragrance through essential oils. Buy the largest bottle you can find — concentrated castile soap is extremely economical when diluted. Store diluted solutions in a cool place and use them within two weeks, as the lack of preservatives means they can harbor bacteria over time.
