## What It Does

A plant-based true soap made by reacting vegetable oils with an alkali — biodegradable, gentle on skin, and effective at cutting grease. A little goes a long way: most recipes call for just 1–2 teaspoons of concentrated castile soap per spray bottle.

## How to Use It

Castile soap is the primary surfactant in many Clean Pantry recipes — it lets water mix with and lift away oil and dirt. You will find it in all-purpose cleaners, dish soaps, floor cleaners, hand washes, and laundry formulas.

**One critical rule**: never mix castile soap directly with vinegar or other acids. The acid reverses the saponification, breaking the soap back into its original oils and leaving a white, curdled residue. If a recipe uses both, apply them in **separate steps** — soap first, rinse, then vinegar.

## Buying & Storage

Dr. Bronner's is the most widely available brand (liquid and bar, scented and unscented). For cleaning, **unscented** ("Baby Unscented") gives you full control over fragrance. Buy the largest bottle you can find — concentrated castile soap is extremely economical when diluted. Use diluted solutions within 2 weeks, as they lack preservatives.

## Enhance It

- **Scented varieties**: Peppermint castile adds a cooling tingle to floor cleaners. Lavender works well in hand soap and linen sprays. Tea tree brings extra antimicrobial action for bathroom recipes.
- **Bar form**: Grate bar castile soap for laundry detergent recipes — it dissolves more slowly but costs less per ounce than liquid.
