## What It Does

Lemon juice is a triple-threat cleaning ingredient: a strong acid that dissolves mineral buildup and hard water stains, a natural bleaching agent that whitens fabrics and surfaces when combined with sunlight, and a potent deodorizer that neutralizes alkaline odors like fish and onion. Its citric acid (pH ~2.0) is strong enough to dissolve calcium carbonate deposits on faucets and showerheads, yet safe enough to use on most kitchen surfaces.

## How to Use It

Lemon juice shows up across dozens of recipes on this site:

- **Hard water remover** — soak a cloth in lemon juice and wrap around faucets for 30 minutes to dissolve mineral buildup
- **Cutting board sanitizer** — scrub with a cut lemon half and coarse salt to kill bacteria and lift stains
- **Laundry whitener** — add 1/2 cup to the rinse cycle and dry in sunlight for natural bleaching
- **Garbage disposal freshener** — freeze lemon juice in ice cube trays and grind through the disposal
- **Copper and brass polish** — mix with salt to create a paste that dissolves tarnish on contact

Fresh lemons and bottled juice are interchangeable for cleaning. One medium lemon yields about 3 tablespoons of juice.

## Buying & Storage

Bottled lemon juice (like ReaLemon) works identically to fresh for cleaning purposes — the citric acid concentration is the same. Buy bottled for convenience and shelf stability; use fresh when you want the rind for scrubbing or zesting. Store fresh lemons at room temperature for up to a week, or refrigerate for up to a month. Bottled juice lasts 6 months unopened, 2-3 months after opening in the fridge.

## Enhance It

- **Lemon-salt scrub**: Cut a lemon in half and dip the cut side in coarse salt. Use as a natural scouring pad for sinks, cutting boards, and cookware. The acid dissolves buildup while the salt provides abrasion.
- **Lemon-vinegar infusion**: Pack lemon peels into a jar and cover with white vinegar. Let steep for 2 weeks, strain, and use as an all-purpose cleaner with a fresh citrus scent.
