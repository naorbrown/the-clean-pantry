name: "Isopropyl Alcohol"
slug: "isopropyl-alcohol"
description: "A fast-evaporating solvent for disinfecting, degreasing, and streak-free cleaning"
category: secondary
scienceSummary: "At 70% concentration, isopropyl alcohol denatures proteins and dissolves cell membranes — more effective than 90% or 99% because the water helps it penetrate bacterial cells."
safetyNotes:
  - "Flammable — keep away from open flames, sparks, and heat sources"
  - "Use in well-ventilated areas — fumes can cause dizziness and headaches"
  - "Not a food-safe sanitizer — use vinegar or hydrogen peroxide for food contact surfaces"
storageInstructions: "Keep tightly sealed in original container, away from heat sources and direct sunlight"
shelfLife: "2–3 years unopened, use within 6 months once opened (evaporates and loses concentration)"

## What It Does

Isopropyl alcohol (also called **rubbing alcohol**) is a fast-evaporating solvent that disinfects surfaces, cuts through grease, and leaves a streak-free finish. It's the go-to ingredient when you need something that dries quickly and completely — electronics, glass, mirrors, and sanitizing sprays.

The key insight: **70% isopropyl alcohol is more effective for disinfection than 90% or 99%**. The 30% water content helps the alcohol penetrate bacterial cell walls rather than just evaporating on contact. Higher concentrations evaporate too fast to do the job.

## How to Use It

You'll find isopropyl alcohol in recipes across several categories:

- **Glass and mirrors** — mixed with water and a drop of dish soap for streak-free shine
- **Electronics cleaning** — used at 90%+ concentration where rapid evaporation is needed (screens, keyboards, phones)
- **Surface disinfection** — 70% solution applied directly or in spray bottles
- **Stain removal** — effective on ink, permanent marker, and adhesive residue
- **Windshield washer fluid** — prevents freezing in cold-weather DIY formulas

Use 70% for most cleaning and disinfecting. Use 90%+ only when you need fast evaporation (electronics, surfaces that can't get wet).

## Buying & Storage

Available at any drugstore or grocery store. Buy the **70% concentration** unless specific recipes call for higher. It's inexpensive — store brands work identically to name brands.

Keep the cap tightly sealed. Isopropyl alcohol evaporates readily, and an open bottle will lose concentration over time. Store away from heat sources — it's flammable with a low flash point.

## Enhance It

- **Streak-free glass cleaner**: Combine 1 cup water, 1 cup 70% isopropyl alcohol, and 1 tablespoon white vinegar in a spray bottle. Rivals commercial glass cleaners.
- **Quick-dry disinfectant spray**: Mix equal parts 70% isopropyl alcohol and water, add 10 drops of tea tree or lavender essential oil. Shake before each use.
- **Adhesive remover**: Apply 90% isopropyl alcohol to a cloth and hold against sticker residue for 30 seconds. The adhesive dissolves cleanly.
