## What It Does

The single most versatile ingredient in natural cleaning. White vinegar's acetic acid cuts grease, dissolves mineral buildup, breaks down soap scum, and kills common household bacteria. If you start with one ingredient, make it this one.

## How to Use It

You will find white vinegar in nearly every recipe on this site — all-purpose sprays, laundry rinses, drain fresheners, glass cleaners, and more. It works in two main ways:

- **Diluted 1:1 with water** for everyday surface cleaning
- **Full-strength** for tougher jobs like mold, mineral deposits, and drain maintenance

**Never use on natural stone** (marble, granite, travertine) — the acid etches and dulls these surfaces permanently. And never mix with bleach, which produces toxic chlorine gas.

## Buying & Storage

The standard 5% grocery-store vinegar is all you need — no benefit to "cleaning vinegar" at a premium. Buy gallon jugs in bulk for the best value. Keeps indefinitely at room temperature in its original container.

## Enhance It

- **Citrus infusion**: Pack a jar with lemon or orange peels, cover with vinegar, and steep for 2 weeks. Strain into a spray bottle — you get extra grease-cutting power and a fresh citrus scent.
- **Essential oil boost**: Add 10–15 drops of tea tree, lavender, or eucalyptus oil per spray bottle for fragrance and mild antimicrobial support.
