White vinegar is the single most versatile ingredient in any natural cleaning kit. Its acetic acid cuts through grease, dissolves mineral buildup from hard water, breaks down soap scum, and kills many common household bacteria. You will find it in nearly every recipe on this site, from all-purpose sprays to laundry rinses to drain fresheners. If you are starting your DIY cleaning journey with just one ingredient, make it this one.

Historically, vinegar has been used as a cleaning agent for thousands of years. The word itself comes from the French "vin aigre" (sour wine), and its antimicrobial properties were recognized long before modern science explained why they work. Today, the distilled white vinegar sold in grocery stores is produced industrially through the fermentation of grain alcohol, resulting in a consistent 5% acetic acid concentration that is ideal for household cleaning.

When buying white vinegar for cleaning, the standard 5% concentration found at any grocery store is all you need — there is no benefit to buying specialty or "cleaning" vinegar at a premium. Buy it in bulk (gallon jugs are the most economical) and keep a spray bottle filled with a 1:1 vinegar-water solution as your everyday go-to cleaner. The one important caveat: never use vinegar on natural stone like marble, granite, or travertine. The acid etches and dulls these surfaces permanently.
