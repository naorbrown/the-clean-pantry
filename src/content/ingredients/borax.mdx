Borax (sodium tetraborate) is a naturally occurring mineral mined from evaporated lake deposits. In DIY cleaning, it serves as a heavy-duty stain remover, water softener, and laundry booster. It is a key ingredient in many homemade laundry detergent recipes, where its alkalinity and water-softening properties help surfactants clean more effectively. Borax also has a long history as a natural pesticide, particularly in ant baits, where its slow-acting toxicity allows worker ants to carry it back to the colony.

Common uses for borax include boosting laundry detergent for heavily soiled loads, removing rust and hard-water stains from toilets and sinks, killing mold and mildew on non-porous surfaces, and creating pest-control baits. It is also used to deodorize garbage cans and inhibit mold growth in damp areas. While borax overlaps with washing soda in some applications (both are alkaline water softeners), borax has the added benefit of pest-control properties and is somewhat gentler on fabrics.

The most important misconception to address is the debate around borax safety. Borax is often marketed as "natural" and "green," which leads some people to assume it is harmless. It is not. Borax is toxic if ingested in significant quantities, and it can irritate skin with prolonged contact. Always wear gloves when handling it, keep it in its original container with the childproof cap, and store it well out of reach of children and pets. That said, borax is no more dangerous than many common household products when handled responsibly. The most widely available brand is 20 Mule Team Borax, found in the laundry aisle of most grocery stores.
