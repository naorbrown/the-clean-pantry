## What It Does

A naturally occurring mineral (sodium tetraborate) that pulls double duty as a heavy-duty cleaner and a natural pesticide. At pH 9.3, borax removes stubborn stains, softens hard water, and boosts laundry detergent — while also disrupting insect digestive systems for slow-acting pest control.

## How to Use It

Borax appears in laundry, deep cleaning, and pest-control recipes:

- **Laundry booster** — add ½ cup to heavily soiled loads
- **Rust and hard-water stains** — make a paste with lemon juice for toilets and sinks
- **Mold and mildew** — dissolve in hot water and apply to non-porous surfaces
- **Deodorizer** — sprinkle in garbage cans and damp areas to inhibit odor and mold

While borax overlaps with washing soda (both are alkaline water softeners), borax adds pest-control properties and is somewhat gentler on fabrics.

**Safety is non-negotiable**: toxic if ingested, irritating to skin with prolonged contact. Always wear gloves, keep the childproof cap on, and store well out of reach of children and pets.

## Buying & Storage

20 Mule Team Borax is found in the laundry aisle of most grocery stores. Store in the original container with the childproof closure, in a high cabinet. Lasts indefinitely.

## Enhance It

- **Ant bait**: Mix 1 tbsp borax with 2 tbsp sugar and enough warm water to dissolve. Place in shallow lids near ant trails. The sugar attracts them; the borax is slow-acting, so workers carry it back to the colony before it takes effect. Keep all baits away from children and pets.
