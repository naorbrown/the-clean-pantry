## What It Does

A gentle triple-threat: mild abrasive, chemical deodorizer, and alkaline booster. Baking soda scrubs without scratching, neutralizes odors at the molecular level (not just masking them), and enhances cleaning power when added to other formulas.

## How to Use It

Baking soda appears across nearly every category on this site:

- **Scrubbing paste** — mix with a little water for sinks, tubs, and stovetops
- **Carpet deodorizer** — sprinkle, wait 15 minutes, vacuum
- **Laundry booster** — add ½ cup to a load for softening and brightening
- **Drain freshener** — pour in baking soda first, then follow with vinegar

The fizzing reaction with vinegar is dramatic but worth understanding — the bubbles are carbon dioxide, and it is the mechanical action of those bubbles that loosens debris. Use them **sequentially** (baking soda first, vinegar second), not pre-mixed.

## Buying & Storage

Buy in bulk — large bags are identical to small boxes but far cheaper per ounce. Arm & Hammer and store brands are the same compound. **Not interchangeable with baking powder**, which contains added acids and starch. Keep sealed in a cool, dry place; an open box absorbs ambient odors and loses cleaning punch within 6 months.

## Enhance It

- **Scented carpet powder**: Mix ½ cup baking soda with 10–15 drops of lavender or tea tree essential oil. Sprinkle on carpets and upholstery before vacuuming for a fresh, natural scent.
- **Heavy-duty paste**: Combine with a few drops of dish soap for a thicker scrubbing paste that clings to vertical surfaces like oven walls and shower tiles.
