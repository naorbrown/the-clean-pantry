Baking soda is a true multi-tasker in DIY cleaning. As a mild abrasive, it scrubs away grime without scratching most surfaces — making it ideal for sinks, tubs, countertops, and stovetops. As a deodorizer, it neutralizes odors chemically rather than masking them, which is why an open box in the fridge actually works. And as an alkaline booster, it enhances the cleaning power of laundry detergent and helps break down greasy messes.

In DIY recipes, baking soda shows up everywhere: mixed into paste for scrubbing, sprinkled on carpets to absorb odors before vacuuming, added to laundry loads as a softener and brightener, and combined with vinegar for that satisfying fizz that helps loosen drain clogs. The fizzing reaction between baking soda and vinegar is dramatic but worth understanding — the reaction itself (producing carbon dioxide, water, and sodium acetate) does not create a stronger cleaner. The mechanical action of the bubbles is what loosens debris. Use them sequentially (baking soda first, then vinegar) rather than pre-mixing them together.

Buy baking soda in bulk — the large bags sold for cooking and cleaning are the same product as the small boxes marketed specifically for deodorizing, but at a fraction of the price per ounce. Arm and Hammer and store brands are identical in composition. One common misconception is that baking soda and baking powder are interchangeable for cleaning. They are not. Baking powder contains additional acidic ingredients and starch that reduce its cleaning effectiveness. Always use pure sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) for cleaning purposes.
