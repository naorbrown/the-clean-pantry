Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful yet environmentally friendly oxidizer that breaks down into just water and oxygen. In DIY cleaning, it serves three primary roles: whitening (laundry, grout, and cutting boards), disinfecting (kitchen surfaces, toothbrushes, and bathroom fixtures), and stain removal (blood, wine, grass, and other organic stains). It is the natural alternative to chlorine bleach, offering similar whitening and disinfecting action without the harsh fumes or environmental impact.

For DIY recipes, always use the standard 3% concentration sold at drugstores — higher concentrations are available but are dangerously caustic and entirely unnecessary for household cleaning. Hydrogen peroxide is a key ingredient in homemade whitening laundry boosters, grout cleaners, and toilet bowl cleaners. It combines well with baking soda to form a potent scrubbing paste for tough stains. However, never mix it with vinegar in a single container — the combination creates peracetic acid, which can irritate skin, eyes, and lungs.

The most important thing to know about hydrogen peroxide is that it degrades when exposed to light. This is why it comes in an opaque brown bottle, and it is why you should never transfer it to a clear spray bottle for long-term storage. If you want it in a spray bottle for convenience, pour out only what you will use within a few days. An opened bottle loses potency over roughly six months. You can test whether your peroxide is still active by pouring a small amount on a cut potato — if it fizzes, it is still good. If it does not, it has broken down to plain water and should be replaced.
