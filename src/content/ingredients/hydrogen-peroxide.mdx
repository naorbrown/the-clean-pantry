## What It Does

A gentle oxidizer that breaks down into just water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide whitens, disinfects, and removes organic stains — the natural alternative to chlorine bleach without the harsh fumes or environmental impact.

## How to Use It

Always use the standard **3% concentration** sold at drugstores — higher concentrations are dangerously caustic and unnecessary for household cleaning. Hydrogen peroxide appears in:

- **Whitening** — laundry boosters, grout cleaners, cutting board refresh
- **Disinfecting** — kitchen surfaces, toothbrushes, bathroom fixtures
- **Stain removal** — blood, wine, grass, and other organic stains

**Never mix with vinegar** in a single container — the combination creates peracetic acid, which irritates skin, eyes, and lungs. **Test on fabrics first** — it can lighten or bleach colors.

## Buying & Storage

Buy the standard brown bottle at any drugstore. **Never transfer to a clear container** — light degrades hydrogen peroxide into plain water. For spray-bottle convenience, pour out only what you will use in a few days. An opened bottle loses potency in about 6 months. **Potato test**: pour a small amount on a cut potato. Fizzes? Still good. No fizz? Replace it.

## Enhance It

- **Power paste**: Mix hydrogen peroxide with baking soda to form a thick scrubbing paste. Apply to grout, tile, or baking sheets, let sit 10 minutes, then scrub. The oxidizer plus the mild abrasive tackles stains that neither ingredient handles alone.
