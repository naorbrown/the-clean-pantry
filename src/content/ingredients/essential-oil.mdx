## What It Does

Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that serve three main roles in DIY recipes: **fragrance**, **antimicrobial action**, and **pest deterrence**. A few drops transform an unscented cleaner into something you actually enjoy using — and certain oils pull double duty with functional benefits.

The most-used oils on this site:

- **Tea tree** — broad-spectrum antimicrobial, effective against mold and mildew
- **Lavender** — calming scent with mild antibacterial properties
- **Lemon** — fresh citrus scent, extra grease-cutting power
- **Peppermint** — invigorating aroma, natural pest repellent (mice, spiders, ants)
- **Eucalyptus** — decongestant properties, strong antimicrobial action

## How to Use It

Most recipes call for **10–20 drops per batch** (roughly 0.5–1 mL). Essential oils are potent — more is not better. A few guidelines:

- **Cleaning sprays**: 10–15 drops per 16 oz spray bottle. Add after mixing other ingredients.
- **Personal care**: 5–10 drops per batch, depending on the product and skin sensitivity. Always patch-test first.
- **Diffusing and fragrance**: Follow your diffuser's instructions — typically 3–5 drops per session.
- **Pest deterrence**: 15–20 drops per spray bottle, or apply undiluted to cotton balls placed near entry points.

Essential oils are oil-soluble, not water-soluble. In water-based recipes, shake well before each use, or add a small amount of castile soap or witch hazel to help emulsify.

## Buying & Storage

Buy from reputable brands that list the botanical name and country of origin on the label. Dark glass bottles (amber or cobalt) protect oils from UV degradation.

Start with **tea tree, lavender, and lemon** — these three cover the vast majority of recipes on this site. Peppermint and eucalyptus are useful additions when you're ready to expand.

Buy the smallest size you'll use within a year. Citrus oils oxidize fastest (12–18 months). Tree and herb oils (tea tree, eucalyptus, lavender) last 2–3 years. Store tightly sealed — oxygen exposure accelerates breakdown.

## Enhance It

- **Blending for scent**: Combine lavender + lemon for a bright, clean fragrance. Tea tree + eucalyptus for a spa-like disinfecting spray. Peppermint + lemon for an energizing kitchen cleaner.
- **Boosting cleaning power**: Add tea tree to vinegar-based bathroom sprays for extra mold prevention. Add lemon to degreasing recipes for extra citrus solvent action.
- **DIY pest control**: Peppermint oil deters mice and spiders. Citronella and lemongrass repel mosquitoes. Cedar oil discourages moths in closets.
