## What It Does

Coconut oil is a plant-based fat that pulls triple duty in DIY recipes: it **moisturizes skin and hair**, provides **antimicrobial action** through its lauric acid content, and **solidifies at room temperature** — making it the structural backbone of balms, deodorants, lotion bars, and salves.

Unlike liquid oils, coconut oil gives solid products their shape without synthetic hardeners. And its mild antimicrobial properties make it a natural fit for personal care products that sit on skin.

## How to Use It

Coconut oil appears across personal care, beauty, and some household recipes:

- **Skin care** — body butter, lip balm, cuticle oil, and after-sun soother
- **Hair care** — deep conditioning masks, frizz taming, and scalp treatments
- **Deodorant** — combined with baking soda and arrowroot powder for natural deodorant bars
- **Soap making** — contributes lather and hardness to cold-process soap recipes
- **Household** — leather conditioner, wood polish, adhesive residue removal, and seasoning cast iron

**Refined vs. virgin**: Use **refined** coconut oil when you want a neutral scent (cleaning, soap making, deodorant). Use **virgin/unrefined** when the coconut aroma is a feature (hair masks, body care).

Melt coconut oil gently — microwave in 15-second bursts or use a double boiler. Overheating degrades beneficial compounds.

## Buying & Storage

Buy in bulk jars for the best value. A 16 oz jar lasts months in personal care recipes since most call for just 1–2 tablespoons per batch.

- **Refined**: Neutral scent, higher smoke point, less expensive. Best for cleaning and products where coconut scent isn't wanted.
- **Virgin/unrefined**: Coconut aroma, more nutrients intact. Best for hair and body care where the scent is a plus.

Both types solidify below 76°F and liquefy above — this is normal and doesn't affect quality. Store at room temperature in a sealed container. Keep utensils dry when scooping — water introduces bacteria that shortens shelf life.

## Enhance It

- **Whipped body butter**: Chill coconut oil, then whip with a hand mixer until fluffy. Add a few drops of lavender or vanilla for scent. Melts on contact with skin.
- **Harder balms**: Combine with beeswax (2:1 coconut oil to beeswax) for lip balms and salves that hold their shape in warm weather.
- **Oil cleansing**: Mix equal parts coconut oil and olive oil for a gentle makeup remover that dissolves even waterproof mascara.
