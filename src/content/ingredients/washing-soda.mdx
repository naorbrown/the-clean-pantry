Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is the heavy-duty sibling of baking soda. Where baking soda is mild and safe for delicate tasks, washing soda brings significantly more alkaline power for tackling stubborn grease, ground-in laundry stains, and grimy outdoor furniture. It is a key ingredient in homemade laundry detergent recipes, where it serves as both a water softener and a cleaning booster that helps surfactants work more effectively.

Beyond laundry, washing soda is excellent for degreasing ovens, cleaning patio furniture, stripping buildup from cloth diapers, and unclogging drains. It softens hard water by binding to calcium and magnesium ions — which is why it dramatically improves cleaning results in areas with hard water. If your homemade cleaners seem to leave a filmy residue, adding a small amount of washing soda to the formula often solves the problem.

The most common brand is Arm and Hammer Super Washing Soda, found in the laundry aisle of most grocery stores. If you cannot find it locally, you can make your own by spreading baking soda on a baking sheet and heating it in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about an hour — the heat drives off water and carbon dioxide, converting sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate. Always wear gloves when handling washing soda, as its high pH can irritate and dry out skin. And never use it on aluminum surfaces, which it will discolor and corrode.
