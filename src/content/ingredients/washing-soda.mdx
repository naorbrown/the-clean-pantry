## What It Does

The heavy-duty sibling of baking soda. At pH 11.6, washing soda brings significantly more alkaline power for stubborn grease, ground-in laundry stains, and grimy outdoor surfaces. It also softens hard water, which dramatically improves cleaning results in hard-water areas.

## How to Use It

Washing soda is a key ingredient in homemade laundry detergent recipes, where it serves as both a water softener and a cleaning booster. Beyond laundry:

- **Oven degreasing** — dissolve 2 tbsp in hot water and spray on baked-on grease
- **Cloth diaper stripping** — soak in a washing soda solution to remove buildup
- **Drain maintenance** — pour ½ cup down the drain, chase with boiling water
- **Hard water fix** — if homemade cleaners leave a filmy residue, a small amount of washing soda often solves it

**Always wear gloves** — the high pH irritates and dries out skin. **Never use on aluminum**, which it will discolor and corrode.

## Buying & Storage

Arm & Hammer Super Washing Soda is found in the laundry aisle of most grocery stores. Keep the box sealed — washing soda absorbs moisture from the air and clumps. Lasts indefinitely if kept dry.

## Enhance It

- **Make your own**: Spread baking soda on a baking sheet and heat at 400°F for about an hour. The heat drives off water and CO₂, converting sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate. Let cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
