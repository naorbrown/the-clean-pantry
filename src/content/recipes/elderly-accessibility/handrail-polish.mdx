## Steps

1. Mix 1 teaspoon of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar in a small bowl.
2. Dip a soft, lint-free cloth into the mixture and wring it out thoroughly. The cloth should be barely damp, not wet.
3. Wipe the handrail from top to bottom in long, even strokes following the grain of the wood.
4. Immediately follow with a separate dry, clean cloth to buff the surface. This step is critical -- buff until the handrail feels smooth but not slippery.
5. Test the grip by firmly grasping the rail and sliding your hand along its length. If it feels slick, buff again with a dry cloth.
6. Repeat the grip test 10 minutes later after the oil has been absorbed.

## Why It Works

Wooden handrails dry out over time, developing a rough, splintery texture that is uncomfortable to grip and can cause small cuts on thin or fragile skin. A tiny amount of olive oil replenishes the wood's natural moisture, keeping it smooth and splinter-free. The vinegar cleans away hand oils, dust, and grime while providing a slight acid that helps the olive oil penetrate the wood grain. The key is using as little oil as possible -- just enough to condition the wood, not enough to create a slick surface.

## Tips

- Less is more. One teaspoon of oil is enough for an entire handrail run. Excess oil is a fall hazard.
- Polish handrails monthly at most. Over-oiling creates buildup that becomes tacky and attracts dust.
- If the rail feels slippery after treatment, wipe it down with a cloth dampened with plain vinegar to remove excess oil.
