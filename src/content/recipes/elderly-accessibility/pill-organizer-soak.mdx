## Steps

1. Remove all pills from the organizer and set them aside on a clean, dry surface where they will not get mixed up.
2. Open all compartment lids fully.
3. Mix 2 cups of warm water, 1/4 cup of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of baking soda in a bowl large enough to submerge the organizer.
4. Submerge the open organizer in the solution and let it soak for 15 minutes.
5. Use a small brush (an old toothbrush works well) to scrub each compartment, the lid hinges, and any crevices where powder residue accumulates.
6. Rinse thoroughly under running water, making sure all compartments are flushed clean.
7. Shake out excess water and set the organizer upright with all lids open to air dry completely.
8. Only refill with medications once every compartment is completely dry. Moisture can degrade pills and capsules.

## Why It Works

Pill dust, coating residue, and moisture from handling accumulate in pill organizer compartments over time. This residue can harbor bacteria and potentially cause cross-contamination between different medications. Warm water dissolves water-soluble pill coatings, vinegar sanitizes and dissolves mineral buildup, and baking soda provides mild abrasive action for scrubbing away stubborn residue stuck in compartment corners and hinge areas.

## Tips

- Clean the organizer every time you refill it for the week. This takes just a few minutes and ensures hygiene.
- Avoid using dish soap -- it can leave a residue that tastes unpleasant and may interact with medication coatings.
- If compartment lids become stiff or hard to open, the warm water soak helps loosen the hinges. Work the lids open and closed while wet.
