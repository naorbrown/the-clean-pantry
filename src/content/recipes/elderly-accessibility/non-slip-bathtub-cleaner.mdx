## Steps

1. Wet the bathtub surface with warm water.
2. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of baking soda evenly across the bottom and sides of the tub.
3. Mix 1/4 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of water in a spray bottle.
4. Spray the vinegar solution over the baking soda. It will fizz on contact -- this is the cleaning reaction working.
5. Let the fizzing mixture sit for 5 minutes.
6. Scrub with a non-abrasive sponge or a brush with a long handle (to avoid bending). Work in circular motions.
7. Rinse thoroughly with warm water, making sure no baking soda residue remains. Run your hand across the tub floor to confirm it is clean but not slippery.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild abrasive that scrubs away soap scum, body oils, and hard water deposits without scratching the tub surface. The vinegar reacts with the baking soda to produce carbon dioxide bubbles that help lift grime from the textured surface of the tub. Unlike commercial cleaners that contain oils or silicone-based shine agents, this formula leaves the tub surface clean and grippy -- critical for fall prevention.

## Tips

- Never use oil-based cleaners or polish in a bathtub or shower. Oils create an invisible slippery film that dramatically increases fall risk.
- Clean the tub weekly to prevent soap scum buildup, which itself becomes slippery when wet.
- If you have non-slip adhesive strips in the tub, scrub gently around them. This cleaner is safe for use on and around adhesive strips.
