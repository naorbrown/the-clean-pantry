## Steps

1. Remove the raised toilet seat from the toilet according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most models unclip or unscrew from the bowl rim.
2. Place the seat in a bathtub or large basin.
3. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda over the entire seat surface, including the underside and the clamping brackets.
4. Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of water and pour the mixture over the baking soda-coated seat. The fizzing helps lift grime from crevices.
5. Let the solution work for 5 minutes.
6. Scrub all surfaces with a cleaning brush, paying special attention to the brackets, hinges, and the underside where urine and moisture accumulate.
7. Rinse thoroughly under running water.
8. Dry completely with a clean towel before reattaching to the toilet. Moisture left on mounting hardware can cause corrosion over time.

## Why It Works

Raised toilet seats have more crevices, brackets, and mounting hardware than standard toilet seats, creating additional surfaces where bacteria, urine, and moisture collect. Baking soda's mild abrasive action scrubs away dried residue while its alkaline pH neutralizes acidic urine odors. The vinegar kills bacteria and dissolves mineral deposits that form in the joints and mounting points.

## Tips

- Clean the raised seat at least twice per week. These seats have more contact surfaces than standard seats and harbor more bacteria.
- While the seat is removed, clean the toilet bowl rim where the seat mounts. Buildup collects there and transfers to the clean seat.
- Inspect the mounting clamps for cracks or looseness each time you clean. A shifting raised seat is a serious fall risk.
