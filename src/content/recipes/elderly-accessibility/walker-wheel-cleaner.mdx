## Steps

1. Lock the walker or rollator wheels if they have brakes. Place the walker on a towel to catch drips.
2. Mix 1 teaspoon of dish soap into 2 cups of warm water in a bowl.
3. Dip an old toothbrush into the soapy water and scrub each wheel, working around the entire circumference.
4. Pay attention to the area where the wheel meets the axle -- hair, lint, and grime accumulate here and cause drag.
5. Use the toothbrush to clear any debris wrapped around the axle.
6. Wipe each wheel with a cloth dampened in clean water to remove soap residue.
7. Dry the wheels and axles completely with a clean towel.
8. Spin each wheel by hand to confirm it rolls freely without catching.

## Why It Works

Walker and rollator wheels pick up dirt, hair, lint, and floor debris that wraps around axles and builds up on wheel surfaces. This creates drag, making the walker harder to push and potentially causing it to pull to one side -- a fall hazard. Dish soap is a surfactant that breaks down the grease and grime binding debris to the wheels, while the toothbrush reaches into the small gaps around the axle that a cloth cannot.

## Tips

- Clean wheels every 1-2 weeks, or more often if the walker is used outdoors. Outdoor grime builds up faster.
- Check rubber wheel tips (if present) for wear while cleaning. Worn tips reduce traction on smooth floors.
- If wheels squeak after cleaning, a single tiny drop of olive oil on the axle shaft eliminates the squeak. Do not over-oil -- excess oil attracts more dirt.
