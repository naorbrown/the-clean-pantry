## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1 1/2 cups of water in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Shake gently to combine.
3. Spray the entire bed rail, covering the top bar, side rails, locking mechanisms, and mounting brackets.
4. Let the solution sit for 1-2 minutes to sanitize.
5. Wipe all surfaces dry with a clean microfiber cloth. Pay special attention to the top rail where hands grip most often.
6. Check that the rail is completely dry and not slippery before it will be used.
7. Inspect the rail's locking mechanism while cleaning to ensure it latches securely.

## Why It Works

Bed rails are high-touch surfaces that accumulate skin oils, sweat, and bacteria from nightly use. People gripping bed rails to get in and out of bed transfer these to the rail surface daily. Vinegar's acetic acid effectively kills common bacteria including Staphylococcus and E. coli while evaporating cleanly without leaving chemical residue. This is important because bed rails are close to the face and bedding during sleep.

## Tips

- Wipe down bed rails 2-3 times per week, or daily if the person is ill.
- Never use bleach on bed rails -- the fumes linger near the sleeping area and the chemical residue contacts skin directly.
- While cleaning, check that all rail bolts and mounting hardware are tight. A loose bed rail that gives way when someone leans on it can cause a serious fall.
