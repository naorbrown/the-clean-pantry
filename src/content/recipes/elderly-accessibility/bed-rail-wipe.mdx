## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1 1/2 cups of water in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Shake gently to combine.
3. Spray the entire bed rail — top bar, side rails, locking mechanisms, and mounting brackets.
4. Let sit for 1-2 minutes.
5. Wipe all surfaces dry with a clean microfiber cloth, focusing on the top rail where hands grip.
6. Confirm the rail is completely dry before use.
7. Inspect the locking mechanism to ensure it latches securely.

## Why It Works

Bed rails accumulate skin oils, sweat, and bacteria from daily gripping. Vinegar's acetic acid kills common bacteria while evaporating cleanly — no chemical residue near the face and bedding during sleep.

## Tips

- Wipe down bed rails 2-3 times per week, or daily during illness.
- Never use bleach — fumes linger near the sleeping area.
- Check that all rail bolts and mounting hardware are tight each time you clean.
