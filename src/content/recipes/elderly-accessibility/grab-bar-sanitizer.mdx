## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1 1/2 cups of water in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Shake gently to mix.
3. Spray the grab bar thoroughly, covering the entire gripping surface and the mounting brackets.
4. Let the solution sit for 1-2 minutes to kill bacteria.
5. Wipe dry with a clean, lint-free cloth. Ensure no moisture remains on the bar -- a wet grab bar is a slippery grab bar.
6. Test the grip by squeezing the bar firmly after cleaning to make sure it is completely dry and non-slippery.

## Why It Works

Grab bars accumulate bacteria, soap residue, and body oils from repeated wet-hand contact. Vinegar's acetic acid kills common bathroom bacteria including E. coli and some strains of Staphylococcus. Unlike bleach-based cleaners, vinegar does not corrode chrome, stainless steel, or plastic grab bar finishes. It also does not leave the chemical residue that could make the gripping surface slick.

## Tips

- Clean grab bars at least twice a week, or more often if they are used multiple times daily.
- After cleaning, always confirm the bar is completely dry before it is needed. Keep a dedicated towel nearby.
- Check grab bar mounting screws monthly while cleaning. A loose grab bar is extremely dangerous. Tighten any loose screws immediately.
