## Steps

1. Remove the shower chair from the tub or shower stall. Place it on a towel or take it outside.
2. Mix 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water in a spray bottle.
3. Spray the entire chair generously -- seat, backrest, legs, armrests, and all rubber feet.
4. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda over the seat and any areas with visible mildew (usually the joints, rubber tips, and underside).
5. Let the solution fizz and work for 10 minutes.
6. Scrub all surfaces with a stiff brush, paying extra attention to crevices where the legs meet the seat frame, drainage holes, and rubber foot caps.
7. Rinse thoroughly with clean water. A garden hose works well if cleaning outdoors.
8. Dry the chair completely before returning it to the shower. Stand it upright to air dry, or towel-dry all surfaces.

## Why It Works

Shower chairs sit in constant moisture, making them prime breeding grounds for mildew and pink mold (Serratia marcescens). Vinegar's acetic acid kills mildew and most mold species on contact. Baking soda provides a gentle abrasive that scrubs away the physical mold growth from textured plastic surfaces and crevices. Regular cleaning prevents the buildup from becoming a health concern for someone who uses the chair daily.

## Tips

- Clean the shower chair weekly. Mildew grows fast in bathroom humidity and can become deeply embedded if left unchecked.
- After each use, stand the chair on its side or lean it against the wall to help water drain off the seat. Pooled water accelerates mildew growth.
- Replace rubber foot caps once a year or when they show wear. Worn caps reduce grip on the tub surface, increasing slip risk.
