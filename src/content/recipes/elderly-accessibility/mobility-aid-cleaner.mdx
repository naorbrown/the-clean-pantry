## Steps

1. Mix 1 tablespoon of castile soap with 2 cups of water in a spray bottle.
2. Shake gently to combine.
3. Spray the solution onto a clean cloth (not directly onto the mobility aid) to control moisture.
4. Wipe down all surfaces: handles, armrests, frames, and seat surfaces.
5. For canes, wipe the entire shaft from handle to tip, including the rubber tip.
6. For walkers and wheelchairs, pay extra attention to armrests and hand grips -- these accumulate the most skin oil and grime.
7. Wipe all cleaned surfaces with a separate damp cloth to remove soap residue.
8. Dry all metal parts thoroughly with a clean, dry towel to prevent rust and corrosion.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a gentle, plant-based surfactant that effectively removes skin oils, sweat, dirt, and bacteria from mobility aid surfaces without harsh chemicals. It is pH-neutral enough to be safe on metal, plastic, vinyl, rubber, and foam padding -- all common mobility aid materials. Unlike alcohol-based wipes, castile soap does not dry out rubber grips or crack vinyl seat covers over time.

## Tips

- Clean mobility aids at least once a week, or more often if they are used outdoors.
- For wheelchair armrest padding that smells, sprinkle baking soda on the pad, let it sit for 15 minutes, then brush off before wiping with the castile soap solution.
- Check rubber cane tips and walker feet while cleaning. Replace them when the tread is worn smooth -- worn rubber tips on smooth floors are a serious fall hazard.
