## Steps

1. Remove the pump head from the dispenser bottle by unscrewing it.
2. Mix 2 cups of warm water with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar in a bowl.
3. Submerge the pump mechanism and the tube in the warm vinegar solution.
4. Pump the mechanism several times while submerged to draw the cleaning solution through the internal tube and nozzle.
5. Let the pump soak for 10 minutes to dissolve any dried soap or lotion buildup inside.
6. Pump several more times in the solution to flush out loosened residue.
7. Rinse the pump under clean running water, pumping a few more times to clear the vinegar.
8. Wipe the outside of the bottle with a cloth dampened in the vinegar solution.
9. Refill the bottle and reattach the pump.

## Why It Works

Pump dispensers clog when soap, lotion, or sanitizer dries inside the tube and nozzle, making them stiff and hard to press -- especially difficult for hands with arthritis or reduced grip strength. Warm water softens the dried product, while vinegar's acidity dissolves mineral deposits and soap scum that accumulate inside the pump mechanism. Regular cleaning keeps the pump action smooth and easy to operate.

## Tips

- Clean pump dispensers every time you refill them. This takes 5 minutes and prevents the buildup that causes stiff pumps.
- If the pump is very stiff, soak it for 30 minutes instead of 10. Very old buildup needs more time to dissolve.
- Choose pump dispensers with wide, easy-push heads rather than narrow triggers. They require less hand strength to operate.
