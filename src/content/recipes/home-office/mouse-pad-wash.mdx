## Steps

1. Fill a basin or sink with warm (not hot) water. Hot water can warp and soften the rubber base.
2. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap and swirl to distribute.
3. Submerge the mouse pad in the soapy water. Let it soak for 5 minutes.
4. Lay the mouse pad flat in the basin, fabric side up. Using a soft brush, scrub the fabric surface in gentle, overlapping strokes. Focus on the center area where your wrist rests and the mouse tracking zone, where oil and dead skin accumulate the most.
5. Flip the pad and gently scrub the rubber underside to remove desk residue and dust that reduces grip.
6. Drain the soapy water and rinse the pad under cool running water, pressing gently to flush soap from the fabric. Continue until the water runs clear.
7. Lay the pad flat on a clean towel. Roll the towel and pad together and press gently to absorb excess water. Do not wring.
8. Lay the pad flat on a drying rack or hang it over a towel bar. Allow it to air dry completely, which may take 8-12 hours. The rubber base takes longer to dry than the fabric surface.
9. Do not use the pad until it is fully dry -- a damp pad slides on the desk and the rubber underside will not grip properly.

## Why It Works

Mouse pads collect skin oil, sweat, dead skin cells, food particles, and dust in their woven fabric surface. Over months, this buildup changes the surface texture, making mouse tracking inconsistent and creating a visible shiny or discolored patch. Castile soap's plant-based surfactants break down the sebum and oils trapped between fabric fibers, while its gentle pH (around 9) will not degrade the rubber base or fabric adhesive the way harsher detergents can. The soaking step allows the warm water to soften dried-on residue and the soap to penetrate the weave. Brushing provides the mechanical action needed to dislodge particles that the soap has loosened but that are still physically trapped between fibers.

## Tips

- Clean your mouse pad every 2-3 months, or monthly if you eat at your desk. A clean pad noticeably improves mouse precision.
- If the mouse pad has developed a permanent odor that does not come out with soap, sprinkle baking soda on the damp surface after washing, let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse.
- Extended desk mats (full-desk size) can be washed in a bathtub using the same method. They take longer to dry -- allow 24 hours.
- If the rubber base is starting to peel from the fabric, the pad is at the end of its life. No amount of cleaning will restore the bond once delamination begins.
- Do not use bleach, rubbing alcohol, or vinegar on mouse pad rubber. These can dry out and crack the rubber base over time.
