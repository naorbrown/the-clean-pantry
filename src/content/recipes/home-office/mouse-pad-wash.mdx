## Steps

1. Fill a basin with warm (not hot) water. Hot water warps the rubber base.
2. Add 1 teaspoon castile soap and swirl to distribute.
3. Submerge the mouse pad and soak for 5 minutes.
4. Lay the pad flat, fabric side up. Scrub with a soft brush in gentle overlapping strokes, focusing on the center tracking zone.
5. Flip and scrub the rubber underside to remove desk residue.
6. Rinse under cool running water, pressing gently until water runs clear.
7. Lay flat on a towel, roll together, and press to absorb excess water. Do not wring.
8. Air dry flat on a rack or towel bar for 8-12 hours.
9. Do not use until fully dry -- damp rubber will not grip the desk.

## Why It Works

Oil and dead skin buildup changes the fabric texture, making mouse tracking inconsistent. Castile soap breaks down oils trapped between fibers while its gentle pH preserves the rubber base and fabric adhesive. Soaking softens dried residue so the brush can dislodge particles trapped in the weave.

## Tips

- Clean every 2-3 months, or monthly if you eat at your desk.
- For stubborn odor, sprinkle baking soda on the damp surface for 10 minutes, then rinse.
- Full-desk mats can be washed in a bathtub. Allow 24 hours to dry.
- Do not use bleach, alcohol, or vinegar on mouse pad rubber -- they crack it over time.
