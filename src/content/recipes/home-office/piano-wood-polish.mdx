## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler: fill a small saucepan with 2 inches of water and place a heat-safe glass jar or smaller pot inside. Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of grated beeswax (or beeswax pellets) and 1 teaspoon of carnauba wax to the glass jar. Stir occasionally until fully melted, about 3-5 minutes.
3. Remove the jar from the double boiler. Slowly pour in 4 tablespoons of food-grade mineral oil while stirring continuously. The mixture will be liquid and golden.
4. Pour the mixture into a shallow tin, glass jar, or other heat-safe container. Let it cool at room temperature for 20-30 minutes until it solidifies into a soft, paste-like wax. Do not refrigerate -- rapid cooling creates a brittle, crumbly texture.
5. While the polish cools, prepare the piano. Dust the entire cabinet (lid, case, legs, music desk, lyre) with a dry microfiber cloth to remove loose dust and particles. Any grit left on the surface will scratch the finish when you apply the polish.
6. Identify your piano's finish type. This polish is appropriate for satin lacquer, hand-rubbed oil finishes, and older shellac finishes. It is NOT appropriate for modern high-gloss polyester finishes (the mirror-like finish on most new grand pianos).
7. Scoop a small amount of the cooled wax paste onto a clean microfiber cloth -- roughly the size of a thumbnail.
8. Apply the wax to the piano cabinet using long, smooth strokes that follow the wood grain. Work in small sections (about 12 inches square) and use light, even pressure.
9. Allow the wax to haze over for 3-5 minutes. You will see the surface turn slightly cloudy as the solvents evaporate and the wax sets.
10. Buff the hazed surface vigorously with the third clean, dry microfiber cloth using circular motions. Apply firm pressure until the surface feels smooth and shows a warm, natural luster.
11. Repeat steps 7-10 for each section of the piano cabinet until the entire exterior is polished.

## Why It Works

Beeswax is a natural ester wax composed of myricyl palmitate, cerotic acid, and about 300 other minor compounds. When applied to wood, it fills the microscopic pores and grain irregularities in the finish, creating a smooth surface that reflects light evenly and feels silky to the touch. Unlike silicone-based polishes that sit on top of the finish as a synthetic film, beeswax bonds with the existing finish through mechanical adhesion, meaning it does not build up into a gummy layer over repeated applications. Mineral oil keeps the wax paste workable and adds a conditioning element that prevents the underlying finish from drying out and developing hairline cracks. Carnauba wax, harvested from Brazilian palm leaves, is the hardest natural wax available. Adding a small amount increases the durability and water resistance of the polish, so it protects the piano surface longer between applications. The combination produces a warm, natural luster that piano craftsmen have preferred over synthetic alternatives for generations.

## Tips

- Apply this polish 2-4 times per year. Pianos in climate-controlled rooms with stable humidity need less frequent polishing than those in rooms with seasonal temperature swings.
- For high-gloss polyester finishes (common on Yamaha, Kawai, and most modern grand pianos), skip wax entirely. These finishes only need a slightly damp microfiber cloth to remove fingerprints, followed by a dry buff. The polyester itself is the protective layer and does not benefit from wax.
- Never use Pledge, Endust, or any spray furniture polish on a piano. These products contain silicone oils that initially create a nice shine but over time migrate into the finish, cause clouding, and make future refinishing or touch-up work extremely difficult.
- If the piano finish has white rings from water glasses or vases, apply the wax polish with extra pressure over the ring and buff vigorously. The wax fills the damaged finish cells that cause the white discoloration.
- Store the wax polish at room temperature in a sealed container. It will keep for 1-2 years. If it dries out, place the tin in a warm water bath to re-soften it.
- When polishing a grand piano lid, support the lid fully open and have someone hold it. Wax can make the surface slippery, and a heavy piano lid falling is a serious injury risk.
