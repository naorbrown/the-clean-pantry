## Steps

1. Remove the guitar strings or loosen them enough to access the full body surface. If you are only doing a quick polish between string changes, work around the strings carefully.
2. Wipe the entire guitar body with a dry microfiber cloth to remove loose dust, fingerprints, and surface debris. Pay attention to the area around the bridge and pickups where dust collects.
3. Identify your guitar's finish type before proceeding. Polyurethane and polyester finishes (found on most modern guitars) are safe for this polish. Satin finishes, nitrocellulose lacquer (common on vintage Gibsons, Fenders, and high-end acoustics), and unfinished wood should not be polished with this recipe.
4. Combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of distilled water in a small glass bottle. Shake well to emulsify.
5. Apply a small amount of the polish -- roughly a dime-sized drop -- onto a clean microfiber cloth. Rub the polish into the guitar body using long, smooth strokes that follow the contour of the body.
6. Work in sections: top, back, sides, then the neck (if the neck has a glossy polyurethane finish). Add more polish to the cloth as needed, but use it sparingly. The cloth should feel barely oily.
7. Let the polish sit on the surface for 2-3 minutes.
8. Buff the entire body with the third dry microfiber cloth using gentle circular motions until the surface feels smooth and shows a clean, even sheen with no oily residue.
9. Inspect the finish under good lighting. If you see any streaks, buff those areas again with the dry cloth.

## Why It Works

Olive oil is a mild triglyceride that fills microscopic scratches and wear marks in polyurethane and polyester guitar finishes, restoring depth and clarity to the surface. These finishes develop a dull, hazy appearance over time as skin oils, sweat salts, and airborne dust create a film that scatters light unevenly. White vinegar's acetic acid dissolves this organic film and cuts through the sticky residue left by hands, guitar straps, and stand contact points. The distilled water helps the vinegar distribute evenly across the surface and prevents mineral spotting. Unlike silicone-based commercial guitar polishes, this oil-and-vinegar blend does not build up a plastic-like layer that becomes progressively harder to remove and can interfere with future refinishing work.

## Alternative

- For nitrocellulose lacquer finishes, skip this recipe entirely. Use a dedicated naptha-dampened cloth to remove grime, then buff dry. Naptha evaporates cleanly and does not react with lacquer. Alternatively, use a commercial carnauba wax polish specifically rated for nitro finishes.

## Tips

- Polish your guitar body every 1-2 months, or whenever it looks dull. Over-polishing with oil can attract dust faster.
- Never use furniture polish (Pledge, Old English) on a guitar. These products contain silicone oils that penetrate finish pores and make future repairs or refinishing nearly impossible. Any luthier will tell you silicone contamination is one of the hardest problems to fix.
- If your guitar lives on a wall hanger or stand, wipe the contact points (where the hanger or stand touches the guitar) during each polish session. Rubber and foam stand pads react with nitrocellulose lacquer and some polyurethane finishes over time.
- Store the polish in a dark glass bottle. Olive oil oxidizes and goes rancid faster in clear containers and direct light.
- For the pickguard area, apply the polish to the cloth only and use lighter pressure. Some vintage pickguards are made of celluloid, which can react unpredictably with solvents.
