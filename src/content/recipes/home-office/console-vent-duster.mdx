tldr:
  - "Clears dust from console, router, and set-top box vents"
  - "Paintbrush and compressed air — no liquids near internals"
  - "Prevents overheating that causes throttling and hardware failure"
category: home-office
difficulty: beginner
prepTime: PT2M
totalTime: PT10M
yield: "Cleans 2-3 devices"
ingredients:
  - name: "Soft-bristle paintbrush"
    amount: "1"
    notes: "a clean 1-inch or 2-inch brush works perfectly"
  - name: "Compressed air"
    amount: "1 can"
    notes: "optional -- for stubborn buildup in tight vents"
  - name: "Microfiber cloth"
    amount: "1"
  - name: "Distilled water"
    amount: "2 tbsp"
    notes: "to dampen the cloth for wiping the exterior"
tags: [home-office, electronics, gaming, dusting, maintenance]
safetyWarnings:
  - "Always power off and unplug devices before cleaning -- never clean electronics while they are running"
  - "If using compressed air, hold the can upright and use short bursts -- tilting can release propellant liquid that damages components"

## Steps

1. Power off the device completely (not sleep mode) and unplug the power cable. Wait 2-3 minutes to cool.
2. Sweep dust from all vent openings, ports, and grilles with the paintbrush. Brush in one direction, pushing dust away from the device.
3. For stubborn dust in narrow vent slits, use compressed air in short 1-2 second bursts. Hold the can upright, nozzle 3-4 inches from the surface.
4. Brush dislodged dust away from the work area.
5. Lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with distilled water and wipe exterior surfaces -- top, sides, and front panel.
6. Wipe around ports (HDMI, USB, ethernet) with a dry corner of the cloth.
7. Let the device air dry 5 minutes before plugging back in.

## Why It Works

Dust-clogged vents restrict airflow and cause devices to run hotter, shortening component lifespan and triggering thermal throttling. A paintbrush is gentler than vacuum attachments (which generate static) and more precise than a cloth for vent slits. Compressed air dislodges dust compacted by months of airflow. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on glossy surfaces.

## Tips

- Clean every 2-3 months, or monthly if the device sits on carpet.
- Never vacuum electronics directly -- the nozzle generates static that damages components.
- Elevate devices off the floor to reduce dust intake.
- If a console or router runs unusually hot or loud, clean the vents before assuming hardware failure.
