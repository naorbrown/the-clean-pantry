yield: "Cleans 2-3 devices"
ingredients:
  - name: "Soft-bristle paintbrush"
    amount: "1"
    notes: "a clean 1-inch or 2-inch brush works perfectly"
  - name: "Compressed air"
    amount: "1 can"
    notes: "optional -- for stubborn buildup in tight vents"
  - name: "Microfiber cloth"
    amount: "1"
  - name: "Distilled water"
    amount: "2 tbsp"
    notes: "to dampen the cloth for wiping the exterior"
tags: [home-office, electronics, gaming, dusting, maintenance]
safetyWarnings:
  - "Always power off and unplug devices before cleaning -- never clean electronics while they are running"
  - "If using compressed air, hold the can upright and use short bursts -- tilting can release propellant liquid that damages components"

## Steps

1. Power off the device completely (not just sleep mode) and unplug the power cable. For routers, also disconnect the ethernet cables if they are in the way. Wait 2-3 minutes for internal components to cool.
2. Use the soft-bristle paintbrush to gently sweep dust from all vent openings, ports, and grilles. Brush in one direction, pushing dust out and away from the device rather than into it.
3. For stubborn dust packed into narrow vent slits, use compressed air in short 1-2 second bursts. Hold the can upright and keep the nozzle 3-4 inches from the surface. Do not tilt the can or use long sustained bursts.
4. Brush any dislodged dust away from the work area so it does not resettle into the vents.
5. Lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with a small amount of distilled water and wipe down the exterior surfaces -- top, sides, and front panel. This removes the dust film and fingerprints that accumulate on glossy and matte casings alike.
6. Use a dry corner of the cloth to wipe around ports (HDMI, USB, ethernet) without pushing dust into the openings.
7. Let the device air dry completely for 5 minutes before plugging back in and powering on.

## Why It Works

Dust is the primary enemy of electronics longevity. Gaming consoles, routers, and streaming boxes pull air through their vents to cool internal components. When dust accumulates on these vents, airflow is restricted, causing the device to run hotter. Elevated temperatures shorten the lifespan of processors, memory chips, and power supplies, and can cause thermal throttling that degrades performance. A soft paintbrush is gentler than vacuum attachments (which generate static) and more precise than a cloth for reaching into vent slits. Compressed air dislodges dust that has compacted over months of continuous airflow. Distilled water for the exterior wipe prevents mineral spots on glossy surfaces, which is especially visible on black consoles.

## Tips

- Clean devices every 2-3 months, or monthly if they sit on carpet or in dusty rooms. Carpet fibers are a major source of the fine dust that clogs vents.
- Never use a household vacuum cleaner directly on electronics. The suction nozzle generates static electricity that can damage sensitive components. A paintbrush and compressed air are much safer.
- Elevate devices off the floor when possible. A simple shelf or stand reduces dust intake significantly compared to sitting on carpet or a low TV stand.
- If your console or router has been running unusually hot or loud, dust buildup is the most likely cause. Clean the vents before assuming the hardware is failing.
- Do not forget your modem, set-top box, and smart home hubs. Any device with ventilation slots benefits from this routine.
