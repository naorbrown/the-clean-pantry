## Steps

1. **Unplug** all cables you plan to clean.
2. Mix equal parts isopropyl alcohol and distilled water in a small bowl.
3. Dampen a microfiber cloth with the solution — wring it out so it's barely moist.
4. Pinch the cloth around each cable and slide from one end to the other, rotating as you go.
5. For sticky residue or tape marks, let the damp cloth sit on the spot for 10 seconds, then wipe.
6. Use a dry corner of the cloth to wipe down connectors and plugs — never let liquid pool near metal contacts.
7. Let cables air dry completely before plugging back in.

## Why It Works

Alcohol dissolves skin oils and kitchen grease while evaporating fast enough to avoid moisture damage. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on dark cables.

## Tips

- Clean cables every time you dust your desk — it takes 2 minutes
- Velcro cable ties make it easier to access individual cords for cleaning
- White cables show grime faster — clean them monthly to prevent permanent yellowing
- Bundle and label cables after cleaning so your setup stays organized
