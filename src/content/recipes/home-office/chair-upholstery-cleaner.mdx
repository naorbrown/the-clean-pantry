## Steps

1. Vacuum the chair with an upholstery attachment to remove hair, dust, crumbs, and debris.
2. Mix 1 cup warm water, 1 tablespoon castile soap, 1 tablespoon baking soda, and 2 tablespoons vinegar in a spray bottle. Let the fizzing settle, then cap and swirl.
3. Spray the fabric lightly and evenly, focusing on the seat center, headrest, and armrests.
4. Let the spray sit for 5 minutes.
5. Scrub gently with a soft bristle brush using small circular motions. Do not press hard enough to push moisture into the foam.
6. Dampen a clean towel with plain water and blot the scrubbed areas. Rinse and wring the towel frequently.
7. For stubborn stains, apply a paste of baking soda and a few drops of water directly to the stain, scrub, and blot.
8. Blot the chair with a dry towel to absorb excess moisture.
9. Place the chair near an open window or fan. Allow 2-4 hours for complete drying.

## Why It Works

Castile soap lifts and emulsifies body oils from the fabric weave. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic compounds that cause stale odor and provides gentle abrasion. Vinegar dissolves dried sweat salt crystals that form white marks on dark fabric. Blotting lifts stains upward into the towel, while rubbing pushes them deeper.

## Tips

- Clean every 1-2 months with daily use, or monthly in hot weather.
- For mesh-back chairs, spray both sides and wipe through from both directions.
- If the seat cushion has a removable zippered cover, wash it separately for better results.
- After cleaning, sprinkle dry baking soda on the seat for 15 minutes, then vacuum to absorb remaining moisture and odor.
