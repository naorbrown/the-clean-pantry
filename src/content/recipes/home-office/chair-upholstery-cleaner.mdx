## Steps

1. Vacuum the chair thoroughly with an upholstery attachment. Remove all loose hair, dust, crumbs, and debris from the seat, back, and armrests.
2. Mix 1 cup of warm water, 1 tablespoon of castile soap, 1 tablespoon of baking soda, and 2 tablespoons of vinegar in a spray bottle. Let the fizzing settle, then cap and swirl.
3. Spray the chair fabric lightly and evenly. Focus on high-contact areas: the seat center, headrest, and armrests where body oil accumulates.
4. Let the spray sit for 5 minutes to break down oils and odors.
5. Scrub gently with a soft bristle brush using small circular motions. Do not press hard enough to push moisture deep into the foam padding.
6. Dampen a clean towel with plain water and blot the scrubbed areas to lift the dissolved grime. Rinse and wring the towel frequently.
7. For stubborn stains, apply a paste of baking soda and a few drops of water directly to the stain, scrub, and blot with the damp towel.
8. Blot the chair with a dry towel to absorb excess moisture.
9. Place the chair near an open window or direct a fan at it. Allow 2-4 hours for complete drying before use.

## Why It Works

Office chairs absorb body oil (sebum), sweat salts, and dead skin cells over months of daily use. These organic compounds become food for bacteria, which produce the stale odor embedded in chair fabric. Castile soap's surfactants lift and emulsify the sebum and body oils, pulling them out of the fabric weave. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic volatile compounds responsible for the odor and provides gentle abrasion for working the cleaner into the weave. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves the dried sweat salt crystals that form white residue marks on dark fabric. The blotting technique is critical -- rubbing pushes stains deeper into the fabric and foam, while blotting lifts them upward into the towel.

## Tips

- Clean your office chair every 1-2 months if you use it daily. If you sit on the chair in workout clothes or during hot weather, clean monthly.
- For mesh-back chairs, spray both sides of the mesh. Flip the cleaning cloth over the back and wipe through the mesh from both directions.
- If the seat cushion has a removable cover with a zipper, unzip it and wash the cover separately with castile soap and warm water. This is far more effective than cleaning through the fabric.
- Armrests accumulate the most body oil. If your chair has fabric armrests, give them extra attention.
- After cleaning, sprinkle a light layer of dry baking soda on the seat and let it sit for 15 minutes, then vacuum it off. This absorbs any remaining moisture and odor from the foam.
