## Steps

1. Remove all strings from the guitar. Fretboard conditioning should be done during string changes, not with strings in place.
2. Inspect the fretboard under good lighting. Unfinished rosewood and ebony should have a slightly moist, dark appearance. If the wood looks grayish, chalky, or shows visible grain lifting, it needs conditioning.
3. Wipe the fretboard with a dry lint-free cloth to remove loose dust and debris.
4. For light grime, apply 2-3 drops of food-grade mineral oil directly onto the cloth, not the fretboard. Rub the oil into one fret section at a time, working it into the wood grain with moderate pressure.
5. For heavy buildup (white residue, caked-on finger grime around fret edges), use 0000-grade steel wool. Rub gently along the length of each fret, following the grain direction. The steel wool will remove dead skin cells, oxidized oils, and surface grime without scratching the frets or wood. Wipe away the loosened debris with a dry cloth.
6. After cleaning, apply a thin coat of mineral oil with the optional 2-3 drops of lemon oil mixed in. Use the cloth to work the oil into the wood, covering the entire fretboard surface and the edges near the fret slots.
7. Let the oil soak into the wood for 5 minutes.
8. Wipe off all excess oil with a clean dry cloth. The fretboard should look refreshed and slightly darker but not wet or shiny. If it looks wet, you used too much -- buff more firmly.
9. Install new strings.

## Why It Works

Unfinished rosewood and ebony fretboards are porous open-grain hardwoods that rely on their natural oil content to maintain structural stability and resist cracking. Every time you play, your fingers deposit sweat (which contains salts and acids) onto the wood while simultaneously pulling natural oils out of the surface through friction and heat. Over months of playing, the wood dries out and the sweat residue builds up as a gray-white film. Food-grade mineral oil is a non-drying oil, meaning it does not oxidize or polymerize the way linseed or tung oil would. It absorbs into the wood's open pores, restores moisture content, and creates a thin protective barrier that slows future moisture loss. Lemon oil's primary component, d-limonene, is a gentle citrus solvent that helps dissolve the protein and lipid residue from skin contact without being aggressive enough to strip the wood's natural oils.

## Tips

- Condition your fretboard every 2-3 string changes, or roughly every 3-6 months depending on how often you play. In dry climates or heated homes during winter, condition more frequently.
- Less is more with oil. Two to three drops per fret section is plenty. Excess oil softens the wood fibers and can make the fretboard feel gummy.
- Do not use "lemon oil" furniture products (like Old English Lemon Oil) on fretboards. These contain silicone, petroleum distillates, and artificial fragrances that harm wood. Use pure food-grade mineral oil with optional real lemon essential oil.
- If your guitar lives in an environment below 40% relative humidity, consider a guitar humidifier in the case. No amount of fretboard oil compensates for prolonged exposure to dry air, which causes fret sprout (frets protruding beyond the fretboard edges) and neck cracking.
- Pau ferro fretboards (common on newer Fender guitars) are denser than rosewood and absorb less oil. Use half the amount and buff more thoroughly.
