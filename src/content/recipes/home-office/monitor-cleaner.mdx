## Steps

1. Turn off the monitor and unplug it. A dark, cool screen makes smudges and dust easier to see and prevents the cleaning solution from evaporating too quickly due to screen heat.
2. Use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe the screen in one direction (top to bottom) to remove loose dust. Do not press hard -- modern screens are fragile and flex easily.
3. Mix 3 oz of distilled water with 1 oz of white vinegar in a small spray bottle.
4. Spray 2 to 3 light spritzes onto the microfiber cloth. The cloth should feel barely damp -- not wet.
5. Starting from the top of the screen, wipe in straight horizontal passes, working your way down. Avoid circular motions, which tend to spread oils and create swirl marks.
6. Flip the cloth to a dry side and repeat the same horizontal passes to buff away any remaining moisture.
7. Inspect the screen at an angle under light to check for remaining streaks. If needed, buff once more with the dry side of the cloth.
8. Clean the monitor bezel (frame) and stand with the damp cloth. These areas are less sensitive and can handle slightly more moisture.

## Why It Works

Distilled water is the key ingredient because it contains zero dissolved minerals. Tap water, even filtered tap water, contains calcium, magnesium, and other minerals that leave visible white residue on dark screens as the water evaporates. The small amount of vinegar (a 3:1 ratio keeps the acidity mild) dissolves the fingerprint oils and skin residue that plain water alone cannot remove. Vinegar evaporates cleanly without leaving the streaky film that soap-based or ammonia-based cleaners produce. Microfiber is essential because its ultra-fine fibers (typically 0.7 denier or finer) are small enough to lift oils and particles without scratching the delicate screen coating. Paper towels, tissues, and regular cloths have fibers that are comparatively coarse and can micro-scratch screen surfaces.

## Tips

- Never use Windex, ammonia-based cleaners, or rubbing alcohol on modern screens. These chemicals strip the anti-glare and oleophobic coatings that manufacturers apply to reduce reflections and fingerprint visibility.
- Do not use paper towels, tissues, or newspaper on screens. The wood fibers in these products are abrasive at a microscopic level and will create fine scratches over time.
- Clean your monitor every 1 to 2 weeks. Dust and oils accumulate gradually and reduce screen clarity and color accuracy.
- This same solution works safely on phone screens, tablet screens, and laptop displays. For touchscreens, it helps restore the slippery feel of the oleophobic coating.
- Wash your microfiber cloth regularly in warm water without fabric softener. Fabric softener coats the fibers and renders them ineffective at picking up oils.

## Alternative

- For a completely vinegar-free option, use plain distilled water alone. It handles dust and light fingerprints effectively, though heavy oil buildup may require two passes.
- Add 1 drop of liquid castile soap to the solution for screens that have accumulated sticky residue (tape adhesive, label residue, or food splatter from a nearby kitchen).
