## Steps

1. Turn off the monitor and unplug it. A dark, cool screen makes smudges easier to see.
2. Wipe the screen top to bottom with a dry microfiber cloth to remove loose dust. Do not press hard.
3. Mix 3 oz distilled water with 1 oz white vinegar in a spray bottle.
4. Spray 2-3 light spritzes onto the cloth. Barely damp, not wet.
5. Wipe in straight horizontal passes from top to bottom. Avoid circular motions.
6. Flip to a dry side and repeat the same passes to buff away moisture.
7. Inspect at an angle under light for remaining streaks. Buff again if needed.
8. Clean the bezel and stand with the damp cloth.

## Why It Works

Distilled water contains no minerals, so it evaporates without leaving white residue on dark screens. The mild vinegar ratio dissolves fingerprint oils that plain water cannot remove and evaporates cleanly without streaks. Microfiber fibers are fine enough to lift oils without scratching delicate screen coatings.

## Alternative

- For a completely vinegar-free option, use plain distilled water alone. It handles dust and light fingerprints effectively, though heavy oil buildup may require two passes.
- Add 1 drop of liquid castile soap to the solution for screens that have accumulated sticky residue (tape adhesive, label residue, or food splatter from a nearby kitchen).
## Tips

- Never use Windex, ammonia, or rubbing alcohol on screens -- they strip anti-glare and oleophobic coatings.
- Do not use paper towels or tissues. Wood fibers micro-scratch screens over time.
- Clean every 1-2 weeks for best clarity and color accuracy.
- Wash microfiber cloths in warm water without fabric softener.
