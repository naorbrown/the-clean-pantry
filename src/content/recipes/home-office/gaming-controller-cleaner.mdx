## Steps

1. Power off the controller and disconnect it. Remove batteries if applicable.
2. Mix 2 oz isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 2 oz distilled water in a spray bottle.
3. Spray onto a microfiber cloth until damp but not dripping. Never spray the controller directly.
4. Wipe face buttons, analog sticks, D-pad, and shoulder triggers. Press into textured grips to lift embedded oils.
5. Dip a cotton swab in the solution and clean seams around buttons, analog stick bases, and trigger gaps.
6. Wipe the back, battery compartment cover, and grip panels.
7. Buff dry with a clean portion of the cloth.
8. Air dry 5 minutes before reconnecting batteries or powering on.

## Why It Works

The 70% alcohol concentration gives enough contact time to dissolve skin oils before evaporating. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on dark plastics. Spraying the cloth instead of the device prevents liquid from seeping into button mechanisms, which causes drift and sticky inputs.

## Tips

- Clean weekly if you game daily. Skin oils on analog sticks accelerate the rubber degradation that causes stick drift.
- Avoid 90% or 99% alcohol -- it evaporates too fast and strips soft-touch coatings.
- This same method works for TV remotes and handheld consoles like the Nintendo Switch.
