## Steps

1. Power off the controller or remote and disconnect it from any console or device. For battery-powered controllers, remove the batteries.
2. Mix 2 oz of isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 2 oz of distilled water in a small spray bottle. Swirl gently to combine.
3. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth until it is damp but not dripping. Never spray directly onto the controller.
4. Wipe down the face buttons, analog sticks, D-pad, and shoulder triggers. Press the cloth into textured grips to lift embedded oils and grime.
5. Dip a cotton swab in the solution and clean the seams around each button, the crevices along the analog stick bases, and the gaps around the triggers. These areas trap dead skin, dust, and snack residue.
6. Wipe the back of the controller, including the battery compartment cover and any textured grip panels.
7. Use a dry portion of the microfiber cloth to buff away any remaining moisture.
8. Let the controller air dry completely for 5 minutes before reconnecting batteries or powering on.

## Why It Works

Isopropyl alcohol at 70% is the ideal concentration for cutting through the skin oils and hand grime that accumulate on controllers during extended gaming sessions. The water content slows evaporation, giving the alcohol enough contact time to dissolve oils and sanitize surfaces. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on dark-colored plastics. Spraying the cloth instead of the device is critical because liquid that seeps into button mechanisms or analog stick assemblies can cause drift, sticky inputs, or short circuits.

## Tips

- Clean controllers weekly if you game daily. Skin oils left on analog sticks accelerate the rubber degradation that causes stick drift.
- Avoid 90% or 99% isopropyl alcohol. Higher concentrations evaporate too quickly to clean effectively and can strip the soft-touch coatings on premium controllers.
- For white or light-colored controllers that have yellowed, this solution helps slow the process but cannot reverse UV-caused discoloration.
- Keep a dedicated microfiber cloth near your gaming setup so cleaning becomes a quick habit rather than a chore.
- This same method works for TV remotes, streaming device remotes, and handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch.
