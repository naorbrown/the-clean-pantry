## Steps

1. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon white vinegar, and 5 drops lemon essential oil in a small glass bottle. Shake to combine.
2. Clear the desk of electronics, papers, and accessories.
3. Wipe the desk with a dry microfiber cloth to remove loose dust and crumbs.
4. Apply a quarter-sized amount of polish to the second microfiber cloth.
5. Rub into the surface using long strokes following the wood grain (or straight lines on laminate).
6. Work in sections. The cloth should be barely damp with oil, not dripping.
7. Let the polish sit for 2-3 minutes to penetrate.
8. Buff vigorously with the dry microfiber cloth until no oily residue remains.

## Why It Works

Olive oil penetrates the pores of finished wood, replenishing oils that dry out from air and heat exposure. Vinegar cuts through the buildup of skin oils and dust films on frequently touched surfaces. Lemon oil dissolves sticky residues like tape marks and sticker adhesive. On laminate, the oil fills micro-scratches, making them less visible.

## Tips

- For laminate desks, reduce olive oil to 1 tablespoon and increase vinegar to 2 tablespoons.
- Polish once a month. Over-polishing creates buildup.
- For dark water rings, apply with extra pressure and buff for a full minute.
- Store in a dark glass bottle -- olive oil oxidizes faster in light.
- Do not use on high-gloss lacquer or polyurethane finishes. Those only need vinegar-water and a microfiber cloth.
