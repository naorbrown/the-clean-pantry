## Steps

1. Combine 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and 5 drops of lemon essential oil in a small glass bottle or jar. Shake or stir to combine.
2. Clear your desk surface of electronics, papers, and accessories.
3. Wipe the desk with a dry microfiber cloth first to remove loose dust and crumbs.
4. Apply a small amount of the polish to the second microfiber cloth -- about a quarter-sized amount for a standard desk.
5. Rub the polish into the desk surface using long, smooth strokes that follow the direction of the wood grain (or in straight lines on laminate).
6. Work in sections, adding more polish to the cloth as needed. The cloth should be barely damp with oil, not dripping.
7. Let the polish sit for 2-3 minutes to allow the oil to penetrate.
8. Buff the surface vigorously with the dry microfiber cloth using circular motions until no oily residue remains and the surface has a clean, subtle sheen.

## Why It Works

Olive oil is a triglyceride that penetrates the microscopic pores and grain of finished wood, replenishing the natural oils that dry out over time from exposure to air, heat, and cleaning products. This prevents the dull, chalky appearance that neglected wood develops. Vinegar's acetic acid cuts through the buildup of skin oils, dust films, and residue from commercial cleaning products that accumulate on frequently touched desk surfaces. Lemon essential oil contributes d-limonene, a citrus-derived solvent that dissolves sticky residues (tape marks, sticker adhesive) and leaves a clean scent. On laminate desks, the oil fills micro-scratches in the melamine surface, making them less visible and restoring a smooth appearance.

## Tips

- For laminate desks, reduce the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and increase the vinegar to 2 tablespoons. Laminate does not absorb oil the way wood does, so less is needed.
- Polish your desk once a month. Over-polishing with oil-based products can create buildup.
- For dark water rings on wood desks, apply the polish with extra pressure and buff for a full minute. The oil fills the damaged wood cells that scatter light and create the white ring appearance.
- Store the polish in a dark glass bottle. Olive oil oxidizes faster in clear containers exposed to light.
- Do not use this polish on desks with a high-gloss lacquer or polyurethane finish -- the oil sits on top and becomes smeary. Those finishes only need vinegar-water and a microfiber cloth.
