## Steps

1. Power off and unplug the device. For wireless devices, remove batteries or switch off.
2. Turn the keyboard upside down over a trash can and shake gently. Tap the back lightly.
3. Use compressed air or a soft brush to clear debris between keys. Hold at a 45-degree angle.
4. Mix 2 oz isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 2 oz distilled water in a spray bottle.
5. Spray onto a microfiber cloth -- never directly onto the device. Damp, not dripping.
6. Wipe key surfaces, gaps between keys, and the palm rest. For crevices, fold the cloth over a plastic card.
7. For a mouse, wipe the top, sides, and bottom sensor area. Use a dampened cotton swab around the scroll wheel.
8. Buff all surfaces dry with the second microfiber cloth.
9. Wait 5 minutes before powering on.

## Why It Works

The 70% concentration evaporates fast without residue but slow enough to dissolve oils and sanitize. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits on dark keys and surfaces. Microfiber fibers trap particles rather than pushing them around.

## Alternative

- If you do not have isopropyl alcohol, undiluted white vinegar works as a mild disinfectant for keyboard surfaces. It evaporates slower and has a temporary smell, but it is safe for plastic and metal keycaps.
- For a deeper antimicrobial clean, use 70% isopropyl alcohol undiluted (without the water). This is appropriate for shared office equipment during cold and flu season but should not be used on matte or coated surfaces.
## Tips

- Do not use on screens -- alcohol damages anti-glare and oleophobic coatings.
- Clean weekly if you eat at your desk.
- For mechanical keyboards, pull keycaps every few months and soak in warm soapy water.
- Avoid drugstore antibacterial wipes -- they contain bleach and quats that damage coatings.
