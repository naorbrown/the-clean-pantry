## Steps

1. Power off the device and unplug it. For wireless keyboards and mice, remove the batteries or turn the power switch off.
2. Turn the keyboard upside down and gently shake it over a trash can to dislodge loose crumbs, dust, and debris. Tap the back lightly with your palm.
3. Use a can of compressed air or a small soft-bristled brush to clear remaining debris from between the keys. Hold the keyboard at a 45-degree angle and blow in short bursts along each row.
4. Mix 2 oz of isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 2 oz of distilled water in a small spray bottle.
5. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth -- never directly onto the device. The cloth should be damp, not dripping.
6. Wipe down the top surfaces of the keys, the spaces between keys, and the palm rest area. For heavily soiled spots, fold the cloth over a thin tool (like a butter knife or plastic card) to reach into crevices.
7. For a mouse, wipe the top surface, sides, and the sensor area on the bottom. Use a dry cotton swab dipped lightly in the solution to clean around the scroll wheel and side buttons.
8. Buff all surfaces with the second dry microfiber cloth to remove any remaining moisture.
9. Wait 5 minutes before powering the device back on to ensure all moisture has evaporated.

## Why It Works

Isopropyl alcohol at 70% concentration is the standard cleaning agent recommended by electronics manufacturers because it evaporates quickly without leaving residue, dissolves oils and organic films (skin oils, food grease, bacterial residue), and does not conduct electricity at the concentrations present on a wrung-out cloth. The 70% concentration is actually more effective as a disinfectant than 90% or 99% because the higher water content slows evaporation, giving the alcohol more contact time with bacteria. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits that tap water would leave behind on dark-colored keys and surfaces. Microfiber cloths have fibers approximately 1/100th the diameter of a human hair, allowing them to pick up and trap particles rather than pushing them around.

## Alternative

- If you do not have isopropyl alcohol, undiluted white vinegar works as a mild disinfectant for keyboard surfaces. It evaporates slower and has a temporary smell, but it is safe for plastic and metal keycaps.
- For a deeper antimicrobial clean, use 70% isopropyl alcohol undiluted (without the water). This is appropriate for shared office equipment during cold and flu season but should not be used on matte or coated surfaces.
## Tips

- Do not use this solution on laptop screens or monitors. Screens require a different cleaning approach (see the Monitor Cleaner recipe on this site). Isopropyl alcohol can damage anti-glare coatings and degrade the oleophobic layer on touchscreens.
- Clean your keyboard and mouse at least once a week if you eat at your desk. Studies have found that the average desk keyboard harbors more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
- For mechanical keyboards with removable keycaps, pull the keycaps off every few months and soak them in warm water with a drop of dish soap. Dry them completely before reattaching.
- Avoid antibacterial wipes from the drugstore (like Clorox or Lysol wipes) on electronics. They contain bleach, quats, and moisture levels that can damage coatings and seep into circuits.
- Cotton swabs dampened with the solution are useful for cleaning around ports, jacks, and trackpad edges.
