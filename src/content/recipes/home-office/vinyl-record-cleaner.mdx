## Steps

1. Mix 6 oz of distilled water and 2 oz of 99% isopropyl alcohol in a clean spray bottle. Add exactly 1 drop of plain liquid dish soap. Swirl gently to combine -- do not shake vigorously, as excessive suds are counterproductive.
2. Place the record on a clean, lint-free surface. A microfiber cloth laid flat on a table works well. Alternatively, hold the record by its edges and center label only -- never touch the grooved playing surface with your fingers.
3. Lightly mist the grooved surface with the cleaning solution. Apply enough to dampen the surface but not so much that liquid pools or runs toward the center label. Keep the spray away from the label -- paper labels absorb moisture and can warp or peel.
4. Using a lint-free microfiber cloth folded into a pad, clean the record by wiping in a circular motion that follows the grooves. Always move in the same direction the stylus travels -- clockwise when looking at the label side up. Never wipe across the grooves radially (from center to edge), as this pushes debris deeper into the groove walls.
5. Apply gentle, even pressure. Let the cleaning solution and cloth do the work. Pressing too hard can push contaminants into the groove floor where they become permanently embedded.
6. After cleaning the first side, flip the record and repeat steps 3-5 on the other side.
7. Dry each side with the second clean, dry microfiber cloth using the same circular groove-following motion. Ensure no moisture remains in the grooves before playing.
8. Let the record air dry upright in a dish rack or record stand for 5 minutes before returning it to its inner sleeve.

## Why It Works

Vinyl record grooves are V-shaped channels roughly 40-50 micrometers wide at the top. Dust particles, skin oils from handling, mold release compound residue from manufacturing, and airborne pollutants settle into these grooves and interfere with stylus tracking. The stylus reads the groove walls' microscopic undulations as audio signal, so any foreign material in the groove produces pops, clicks, and surface noise. Distilled water provides the bulk cleaning medium without introducing dissolved minerals that would crystallize in the grooves as the water evaporates. Isopropyl alcohol at 99% concentration acts as a fast-evaporating solvent that dissolves finger oils and organic contaminants without leaving a residue. The single drop of dish soap serves as a surfactant, reducing the surface tension of the water-alcohol mixture so it can penetrate into the narrow groove floor rather than beading up on the vinyl surface. PVC (polyvinyl chloride), the material vinyl records are made from, is resistant to both isopropyl alcohol and mild detergents at these concentrations.

## Tips

- Clean records before their first play after purchase, especially used records. Thrift store and garage sale finds often have years of accumulated dust, mold, and handling residue that a single cleaning dramatically improves.
- Do not use tap water under any circumstances. The calcium and mineral deposits from tap water create a white residue in the grooves that is nearly impossible to remove and causes permanent surface noise.
- For heavily soiled records, let the cleaning solution sit on the surface for 30 seconds before wiping. This gives the surfactant time to penetrate into the groove floor.
- Never use this solution on shellac 78 RPM records. Shellac is an alcohol-soluble resin, and isopropyl alcohol will dissolve the playing surface. Use distilled water only for shellac records.
- Store cleaned records in new anti-static inner sleeves (HDPE or rice paper). Old paper sleeves shed fibers that recontaminate the grooves. Anti-static sleeves also reduce the static charge that attracts dust.
- Clean your turntable stylus regularly as well. A dirty stylus drags contaminants through every groove it plays, defeating the purpose of clean records. A stylus brush with a back-to-front motion after each side is good practice.
