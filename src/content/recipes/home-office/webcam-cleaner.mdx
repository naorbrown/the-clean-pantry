## Steps

1. Mix 1 oz of distilled water with 1 oz of isopropyl alcohol (70%) in a small 2 oz spray bottle.
2. Power off the webcam or close the laptop lid to prevent accidental input while cleaning.
3. Spray 1-2 spritzes onto a clean microfiber cloth. The cloth should be slightly damp, not wet.
4. Gently wipe the webcam lens using a circular motion, starting from the center and spiraling outward. Use light pressure -- lens coatings can be damaged by heavy pressing.
5. If there are fingerprints or smudges, breathe a gentle fog of warm breath onto the lens, then immediately wipe with the damp cloth.
6. Buff with a dry section of the microfiber cloth to remove any remaining streaks.
7. For external webcam housings, wipe the plastic body with the damp cloth to remove dust and fingerprints.

## Why It Works

Webcam lenses collect a thin film of airborne dust, skin oil vapors, and fingerprints from adjustment. This film scatters light before it reaches the sensor, degrading image quality and making video calls look hazy. The 50/50 mixture of isopropyl alcohol and distilled water dissolves the organic oil film (the alcohol component) and rinses away mineral dust particles (the water component) without leaving mineral deposits of its own, since distilled water contains no dissolved minerals. The rapid evaporation rate of 70% isopropyl alcohol means the lens dries before watermarks can form, which is what produces the streak-free result. Tap water contains calcium, magnesium, and chlorine that leave visible spots on glass -- this is why distilled water is essential for optics.

## Tips

- Clean your webcam lens before important video calls. Even a thin oil film that is invisible to the naked eye reduces the sharpness and contrast of your video feed.
- This same solution works for cleaning eyeglasses, phone camera lenses, and tablet screens.
- Use a dedicated microfiber cloth for lens cleaning only. A cloth that has been used for desk or screen cleaning may carry grit particles that scratch lens coatings.
- Store the spray bottle away from direct sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol evaporates slowly even through sealed caps.
- For built-in laptop webcams, be extra gentle -- the lens is recessed and the surrounding bezel is often thin plastic.
- This solution also works for cleaning laser mouse sensors if they become dirty and track erratically.
