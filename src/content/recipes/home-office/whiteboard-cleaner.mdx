## Steps

1. Erase the whiteboard with a standard dry eraser to remove as much marker as possible.
2. Mix 1/2 cup of water, 1/4 cup of white vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of isopropyl alcohol in an 8 oz spray bottle. Swirl to combine.
3. Spray the entire whiteboard surface evenly. Let the solution sit for 1-2 minutes to dissolve the ghosting residue.
4. Wipe the board with a clean microfiber cloth using broad, horizontal strokes from top to bottom. Fold the cloth to a clean section as it picks up residue.
5. For stubborn ghost marks that remain after the first pass, spray those areas again and scrub with moderate pressure using circular motions.
6. Wipe the entire board once more with a clean, damp cloth (plain water) to remove any vinegar residue.
7. Dry the board with a clean cloth or let it air dry for 5 minutes before writing on it again.

## Why It Works

Whiteboard ghosting occurs because dry erase markers leave behind a thin layer of polymer resin and pigment that bonds to the whiteboard's melamine surface over time. Fresh marker ink sits on top of this residue layer and erases normally, but the underlying ghost layer becomes increasingly difficult to remove with a dry eraser alone. Isopropyl alcohol is a solvent that dissolves the polymer binder in dry erase marker ink, breaking the bond between the ghost residue and the board surface. Vinegar's acetic acid works on the pigment component, dissolving the metal oxide pigments (titanium dioxide in white, iron oxide in red and brown) that remain after the polymer is dissolved. Together, they address both components of the ghost mark. The brief soaking time is important because it gives the solvents time to penetrate and soften the aged residue layer.

## Tips

- Clean your whiteboard every 1-2 weeks if you use it daily. Ghosting builds up gradually, and regular cleaning prevents it from becoming permanent.
- If ghosting is severe (months of buildup), you may need to apply the solution 2-3 times, letting it sit for 5 minutes each round.
- Avoid using paper towels on whiteboards. They leave behind tiny paper fibers that create streaks when you write over them.
- Low-quality dry erase markers ghost faster than premium brands because they contain more residue-forming polymer and less easily-erased silicone release agent.
- After deep cleaning, you can apply a very thin coat of whiteboard conditioner (or even a tiny amount of the desk polish from this site) to restore the slippery surface.
- Never use abrasive cleaners or scrub pads on a whiteboard -- they scratch the melamine coating and make ghosting worse over time.
