## Steps

1. Power off the synthesizer or MIDI controller and unplug it from the wall and from any connected audio cables. Wait 30 seconds for residual charge to dissipate.
2. Use a soft bristle brush to sweep loose dust from the entire surface, paying close attention to the gaps between keys, the slots around faders, and the base of rotary knobs. Work from top to bottom so debris falls away from the instrument.
3. Mix 2 oz of distilled water with 2 oz of isopropyl alcohol (70%) in a small spray bottle.
4. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth until it is damp but not dripping. Wipe down the key surfaces from back to front. For rubber or silicone keys (common on MIDI controllers and pad controllers like the Akai MPC), use light pressure -- rubber keys are more porous than plastic and absorb liquid more easily.
5. For rotary knobs and encoders, dampen a cotton swab with the solution. Wipe around the base of each knob where dust and skin oils accumulate. Rotate the knob while cleaning to access all sides. Do not force liquid down the potentiometer shaft.
6. For faders (linear sliders), dampen a cotton swab and gently wipe along the slot on both sides of the fader cap. Move the fader to its full range of travel while cleaning to expose the entire slot. Use a dry swab immediately after to absorb excess moisture.
7. Clean patch cable jacks by inserting a lightly dampened cotton swab into each jack opening and rotating gently. Dry with a clean swab. Oxidized jacks (visible green or dark residue) benefit from a few extra passes.
8. Wipe the outer casing, sides, and back panel with the damp microfiber cloth. Pay attention to ventilation slots and heat sink areas where dust collects.
9. For pitch and mod wheels, wipe the wheel surface and the slot it sits in. These collect significant finger grime due to constant skin contact.
10. Buff all surfaces with the dry microfiber cloth and let the instrument air dry for 10 minutes before reconnecting cables and powering on.

## Why It Works

Synthesizers and MIDI controllers face a unique combination of contaminants: skin oils from extended playing sessions, dust drawn in by the cooling fans and electrostatic charge of circuit boards, and environmental smoke or humidity that coats every surface. The 70% isopropyl alcohol solution works because it evaporates fast enough to avoid moisture damage to electronics while staying wet long enough to dissolve the mixture of sebaceous oils and dust that forms a conductive film on contact surfaces. This film is the primary cause of "scratchy" potentiometers -- when you turn a knob and hear crackling through the audio output, that is particulate debris on the resistive element inside the pot. Surface cleaning reduces the amount of debris that migrates into the potentiometer housing over time. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits that could create unwanted electrical resistance on contact points. The soft bristle brush is critical for fader slots because compressed air, while tempting, can force dust particles deeper into the fader mechanism where they grind against the conductive track.

## Alternative

- For potentiometers that are already scratchy (crackling when turned), surface cleaning alone will not fix the problem. You need a dedicated electronics contact cleaner (like DeoxIT D5) applied sparingly into the potentiometer housing through the shaft opening. This is a more invasive repair but is the only effective solution for internal oxidation.

## Tips

- Clean your synth or controller every 1-2 months if it sits in a home studio, or after every gig if it travels. Road grime, spilled drinks, and venue dust are far more aggressive than home studio dust.
- Never use household glass cleaner (Windex), bleach wipes, or all-purpose cleaner on synthesizers. The ammonia and surfactants in these products can damage rubber keys, strip lettering, and leave conductive residue on circuit board traces.
- If rubber pads on a MIDI controller feel sticky or tacky (a common issue with older Akai, Novation, and Arturia gear), wipe them with a cloth dampened with the cleaning solution and let them dry completely. The stickiness is caused by the plasticizer in the rubber migrating to the surface as the rubber ages.
- Cover your synthesizer with a dust cover or clean cloth when not in use. Dust is the single biggest enemy of faders and potentiometers. A $10 dust cover saves hundreds in repairs.
- For LED-backlit keys and buttons, clean gently. Some backlit silicone pads have thin light-diffusing coatings that aggressive scrubbing can damage.
- Patch cables should be cleaned at the tip (the metal plug) with a cotton swab dampened in the solution every few months. Oxidized plugs cause signal degradation and intermittent connections.
