## Steps

1. **Unplug the power strip** from the wall outlet. Unplug all devices from it.
2. Use a dry soft-bristle paintbrush to sweep dust out of each socket opening. Hold the strip upside down so debris falls out.
3. Dampen a cotton swab with the alcohol-water mix and carefully clean around the outside edges of each socket — never push liquid inside.
4. Wipe down the entire exterior casing with a barely-damp microfiber cloth.
5. Clean the power cord using the pinch-and-slide method (see our Cable & Wire Cleaner recipe).
6. Let the strip air dry for at least 10 minutes before plugging anything back in.

## Why It Works

Power strips sit behind desks and under furniture where dust accumulates fast. Dust buildup in and around outlets is a fire hazard — the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission lists dusty outlets as a contributing factor in electrical fires. Regular cleaning reduces this risk and keeps connections reliable.

## Tips

- Clean power strips every 2–3 months, or monthly in dusty environments
- Never use a wet cloth or spray bottle near socket openings
- If a power strip looks scorched, cracked, or discolored around any outlet, replace it immediately
- Surge protectors lose effectiveness over time — check the indicator light regularly
