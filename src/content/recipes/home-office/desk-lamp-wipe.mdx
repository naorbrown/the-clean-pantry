## Steps

1. Turn off the lamp and unplug it. If the bulb has been on, wait 10-15 minutes for it to cool.
2. Mix 3/4 cup of water with 1/4 cup of white vinegar in an 8 oz spray bottle.
3. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth -- not directly onto the lamp.
4. Wipe the lamp arm, base, and shade or housing. Start at the top and work down so loosened dust falls onto uncleaned areas rather than clean ones.
5. For adjustable arm joints and hinges, fold the cloth into a narrow strip and work it into the crevices where dust collects.
6. For the lamp shade or diffuser, remove it if possible and wipe both the inside and outside. Dust on the inside of a shade reduces light output significantly.
7. Wipe the bulb gently with a barely damp section of the cloth. For LED panels, wipe the clear cover only.
8. Buff all surfaces with a dry section of the cloth to remove any remaining dampness and polish away streaks.
9. Plug the lamp back in after everything is fully dry.

## Why It Works

Desk lamps are dust magnets for two reasons: they generate heat (which creates convective air currents that carry dust particles upward) and they carry a slight static charge from their electrical wiring. This combination means lamps accumulate dust faster than most other desk items. The dust layer on bulbs and diffusers absorbs light, reducing the effective brightness of the lamp by as much as 20-30% over several months. Fingerprints on lamp arms and bases are a mixture of skin oils and sweat salts. Vinegar dissolves both the salt crystals and cuts through the oil film, while the microfiber cloth's ultra-fine fibers trap the particles rather than smearing them across the surface.

## Tips

- Clean your desk lamp monthly. You will be surprised how much brighter it is after a simple wipe-down.
- The inside of lampshades and diffuser covers collects more dust than the outside because of the heat-driven air current. Cleaning the interior has the biggest impact on light output.
- For brushed metal lamp surfaces, always wipe in the direction of the brushing to avoid visible cross-grain streaks.
- LED desk lamps with plastic diffuser panels can develop a hazy film over time. The vinegar solution clears this effectively.
- If you have a monitor light bar (the kind that clips onto the top of your monitor), clean the underside monthly -- it is directly above your workspace and sheds dust onto your desk.
- This same solution works for cleaning floor lamp poles, pendant light fixtures, and ceiling fan blades.
