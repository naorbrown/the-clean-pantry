## Steps

1. Turn off the lamp and unplug it. If the bulb has been on, wait 10-15 minutes to cool.
2. Mix 3/4 cup of water with 1/4 cup of white vinegar in an 8 oz spray bottle.
3. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth -- not directly onto the lamp.
4. Wipe the arm, base, and shade. Start at the top and work down.
5. Fold the cloth into a narrow strip for adjustable arm joints and hinge crevices.
6. Remove the shade or diffuser if possible and wipe both inside and outside.
7. Wipe the bulb gently with a barely damp section. For LED panels, wipe the clear cover only.
8. Buff all surfaces dry with a clean section of the cloth.
9. Plug the lamp back in after everything is fully dry.

## Why It Works

Lamps accumulate dust faster than most desk items because heat creates convective air currents and wiring carries a static charge. Dust on bulbs and diffusers absorbs light, reducing brightness by 20-30% over months. Vinegar dissolves the sweat salts and cuts through the oil film from fingerprints. Microfiber traps particles rather than smearing them.

## Tips

- Clean monthly. The inside of shades collects more dust than the outside -- cleaning it has the biggest impact on brightness.
- For brushed metal, wipe in the direction of the brushing to avoid cross-grain streaks.
- Monitor light bars shed dust onto your desk -- clean the underside monthly.
- This same solution works for floor lamps, pendant fixtures, and ceiling fan blades.
