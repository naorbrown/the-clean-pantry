## Steps

1. Mix 1 oz of distilled water, 1 oz of isopropyl alcohol, and 1 drop of dish soap in a small 2 oz spray bottle. Swirl gently to combine.
2. Remove silicone ear tips from earbuds if applicable. Wash the silicone tips separately with warm water and a drop of dish soap, rinse, and set aside to dry.
3. Use a dry soft-bristle brush to loosen any earwax or debris from earbud speaker grilles and mesh screens. Brush gently in one direction, not back and forth, to avoid pushing debris deeper.
4. Spray the cleaning solution onto a cotton swab (not directly onto the headphones). Carefully clean around the speaker grille, the earbud stem, and any crevices. Use a dry swab to follow up.
5. For over-ear headphones, remove the ear cushions if they are detachable. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth and wipe down the ear cushion surfaces (both the side that touches your ear and the side that faces the driver).
6. Wipe the headband, hinges, and adjustment sliders with the damp microfiber cloth.
7. For the microphone boom on gaming headsets, wipe with a damp cotton swab and dry immediately.
8. Allow all components to air dry for 15-20 minutes before reassembling and using.

## Why It Works

Headphones and earbuds sit against warm skin and absorb sweat, skin oil, and earwax during use. Earwax is a mixture of dead skin cells, fatty acids, squalene, and cholesterol that hardens when exposed to air. Isopropyl alcohol dissolves earwax effectively because wax is lipophilic (fat-soluble) and alcohol is a strong degreasing solvent. The single drop of dish soap adds surfactant action that helps lift stubborn wax from textured surfaces like speaker mesh without the volume of suds that would be difficult to rinse from electronics. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits in the fine mesh of speaker grilles, where even small mineral crystals from tap water can partially block sound-emitting holes and degrade audio quality.

## Tips

- Clean earbuds weekly if you use them daily. Wax buildup on the speaker grille measurably reduces sound quality, particularly in the high frequencies.
- For earbuds with wax guards (small mesh screens in the nozzle), replace these according to the manufacturer's schedule. No amount of cleaning fully restores a clogged wax guard.
- Leather and protein leather ear cushions on over-ear headphones degrade faster when exposed to sweat. Wiping them after each gym or commute session extends their life significantly.
- Store earbuds in their case after cleaning rather than loose in a pocket or bag. This prevents dust and lint from collecting on the speakers between uses.
- If your headphones have a persistent smell in the ear cushions, remove the cushions and sprinkle baking soda on both sides. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then brush it off before wiping with the cleaning solution.
