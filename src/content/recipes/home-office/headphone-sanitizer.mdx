## Steps

1. Mix 1 oz distilled water, 1 oz isopropyl alcohol, and 1 drop dish soap in a 2 oz spray bottle.
2. Remove silicone ear tips if applicable. Wash them separately with warm water and dish soap, then set aside to dry.
3. Brush earwax and debris from speaker grilles with a dry soft-bristle brush. Brush in one direction only.
4. Spray the solution onto a cotton swab (not directly onto the headphones). Clean around the speaker grille, stem, and crevices. Follow with a dry swab.
5. For over-ear headphones, remove detachable ear cushions. Wipe both sides with a solution-dampened microfiber cloth.
6. Wipe the headband, hinges, and adjustment sliders.
7. For gaming headset mic booms, wipe with a damp cotton swab and dry immediately.
8. Air dry all components 15-20 minutes before reassembling.

## Why It Works

Earwax hardens when exposed to air, forming a stubborn coating on speaker mesh. Alcohol dissolves it because wax is fat-soluble. The single drop of dish soap adds surfactant action that lifts wax from textured surfaces without excess suds. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits in speaker grille mesh, where even small crystals degrade audio quality.

## Tips

- Clean earbuds weekly if used daily. Wax buildup reduces high-frequency sound quality.
- Replace wax guards on schedule -- cleaning cannot fully restore a clogged guard.
- Wipe leather ear cushions after sweaty sessions to extend their life.
- For persistent cushion odor, sprinkle baking soda on both sides for 30 minutes, brush off, then wipe with the cleaning solution.
