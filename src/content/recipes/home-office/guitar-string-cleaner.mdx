yield: "Enough for multiple cleanings"
ingredients:
  - name: "Isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher)"
    amount: "1 tbsp"
    notes: "90% preferred here -- higher concentration evaporates faster and leaves no moisture on strings"

## Steps

1. Lay the guitar flat on a clean towel or soft surface with the strings facing up.
2. Apply approximately 1 tablespoon of 90% isopropyl alcohol to a lint-free cloth. The cloth should be damp, not dripping.
3. Slide the cloth underneath the strings so the strings rest in the middle of the cloth. Pinch the cloth around the strings from above and below.
4. While pinching the cloth firmly around the strings, slide it slowly from the nut down to the bridge. Maintain steady pressure to ensure the cloth contacts all sides of each string.
5. Repeat 2-3 times per string, repositioning the cloth to a clean section each time so you are not redistributing grime.
6. For the wound strings (the thicker bass strings), twist the cloth slightly as you slide to get into the grooves between the windings where dead skin and oils collect.
7. Release the cloth and let the strings air dry for 30 seconds. The alcohol evaporates almost immediately at 90% concentration.
8. Play a few notes to verify the strings feel clean and smooth. Freshly cleaned strings should feel noticeably slicker and brighter-sounding.

## Why It Works

Guitar strings lose their brightness and sustain primarily because of two factors: corrosion from sweat and mechanical damping from grime. Human sweat contains chloride ions, lactic acid, and urea, all of which react with the nickel, steel, or bronze alloys in guitar strings. This corrosion creates microscopic pitting on the string surface that deadens vibration. In the wound strings, dead skin cells, sebaceous oils, and dust pack into the grooves between windings, adding mass unevenly along the string and damping the higher-frequency overtones that give strings their "sparkle." Isopropyl alcohol at 90% concentration is an excellent degreaser that dissolves these organic deposits quickly without leaving water behind. Water is the enemy here -- it accelerates oxidation on bare metal strings, which is why 90% is preferred over the 70% typically used for surface disinfection.

## Tips

- Clean your strings after every playing session for maximum lifespan. This single habit can double or triple the usable life of a set of strings.
- Do not use this method on coated strings (Elixir, D'Addario XTE, etc.). The alcohol can degrade the polymer coating that gives those strings their extended life. Coated strings only need a dry wipe.
- Do not use this on nylon classical guitar strings. Alcohol can dry out and weaken nylon over time.
- Wash your hands with soap and water before playing. Removing skin oils before they get on the strings is more effective than cleaning them off after.
- If you do not have 90% isopropyl alcohol, 70% works but takes longer to evaporate. Wipe with a dry cloth immediately after to remove residual moisture.
- Some players boil old bass guitar strings in water to remove deep grime from the windings. This works for a temporary revival but the metal is already fatigued, so the effect lasts only a few playing sessions.
