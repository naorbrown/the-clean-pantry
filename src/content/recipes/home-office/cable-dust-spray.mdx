## Steps

1. Shut down your computer and unplug the power strip from the wall outlet. Unplug individual cables from devices where possible.
2. Mix 3/4 cup of water with 1/4 cup of white vinegar in an 8 oz spray bottle.
3. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth until damp but not dripping.
4. For individual cables, pinch the damp cloth around the cable and slide it along the length, rotating the cloth as you go. Dust and grime will transfer onto the cloth.
5. For cable bundles held together with ties or clips, clean each cable where it is exposed. Use a dry corner of the cloth to reach into tight bundle sections.
6. Wipe down the exterior of power strips, surge protectors, and charging hubs with the damp cloth. Pay attention to the crevices along the top edge where dust settles.
7. Use a dry microfiber cloth to buff all cables and surfaces dry.
8. For areas behind the desk where cables meet the wall, wipe the wall surface and baseboards with the damp cloth to remove the dust that accumulates in cable runs.
9. Wait 5-10 minutes for everything to dry fully, then reconnect cables and restore power.

## Why It Works

Cables and power strips attract dust through static electricity. The electrical current flowing through insulated cables creates a weak electromagnetic field on the cable surface, which attracts and holds fine dust particles. Over time, this dust layer traps moisture from the air, creating a grime film that becomes sticky and harder to remove. Vinegar's acetic acid cuts through this static-bonded grime film more effectively than plain water because it neutralizes the slight alkaline charge in household dust (which is largely composed of skin cells, fabric fibers, and calcium carbonate particles). The microfiber cloth's split fibers physically trap the loosened dust particles rather than redistributing them into the air.

## Tips

- Clean cables every 2-3 months. In dusty environments, monthly cleaning prevents buildup from becoming a fire hazard on power strips.
- White cables and charging cords show grime fastest. Cleaning them regularly keeps your workspace looking maintained.
- When cleaning behind the desk, take a photo of your cable arrangement before unplugging anything. This saves time when reconnecting.
- For USB and other small connectors, use a dry cotton swab to clean inside the connector housing. Do not use the wet cloth on exposed metal contacts.
- Dust on top of power strips can conduct small amounts of electricity in humid conditions. Keeping power strips clean is a genuine safety measure, not just cosmetic.
- After cleaning, consider using cable clips or sleeves to keep cables organized and reduce the surface area exposed to dust.
