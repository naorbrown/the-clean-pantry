## Steps

1. Shut down your computer and unplug the power strip. Unplug individual cables from devices where possible.
2. Mix 3/4 cup of water with 1/4 cup of white vinegar in an 8 oz spray bottle.
3. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth until damp but not dripping.
4. Pinch the damp cloth around each cable and slide along its length, rotating as you go.
5. For cable bundles, clean each cable where exposed. Use a dry corner of the cloth for tight sections.
6. Wipe the exterior of power strips, surge protectors, and charging hubs. Focus on the top-edge crevices where dust settles.
7. Buff all cables and surfaces dry with a clean microfiber cloth.
8. Wipe the wall surface and baseboards behind the desk where cables run.
9. Wait 5-10 minutes for everything to dry, then reconnect and restore power.

## Why It Works

Cables attract dust through the weak electromagnetic field their current creates. Over time, this dust traps moisture and forms a sticky grime film. Vinegar cuts through this film by neutralizing the alkaline charge in household dust. Microfiber's split fibers trap loosened particles rather than redistributing them into the air.

## Tips

- Clean cables every 2-3 months, or monthly in dusty environments.
- Photo your cable arrangement before unplugging anything behind the desk.
- For USB and other small connectors, use a dry cotton swab inside the housing. Do not use the wet cloth on exposed metal contacts.
- After cleaning, use cable clips or sleeves to reduce dust-exposed surface area.
