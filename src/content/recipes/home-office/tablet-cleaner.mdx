## Steps

1. Power off the tablet or e-reader and let it sit for a minute. Cleaning a warm screen causes the solution to evaporate unevenly, leaving streaks.
2. Mix 1 cup of distilled water with 1 tablespoon of isopropyl alcohol (70%) in a small spray bottle. Swirl gently to combine.
3. Spray the solution lightly onto a clean microfiber cloth. The cloth should be barely damp -- not wet. One or two sprays is enough for a single tablet screen.
4. Gently wipe the screen in one direction -- either top to bottom or left to right. Avoid circular motions, which can spread oils around rather than lifting them off.
5. Flip the cloth to a dry side and buff the screen in the same one-directional motion. This removes any remaining moisture and leaves a streak-free finish.
6. Wipe the back, edges, and any buttons or ports with the damp side of the cloth. These areas collect oils and crumbs from handling.
7. Let the device air dry for 2-3 minutes before powering back on.

## Why It Works

The small amount of isopropyl alcohol dissolves the fingerprint oils and skin residue that accumulate on touchscreens from constant tapping and swiping. At just 1 tablespoon per cup of water, the alcohol concentration is low enough to be safe for the oleophobic (oil-repelling) coating that manufacturers apply to modern touchscreens -- this coating is what makes your finger glide smoothly across the glass. Higher alcohol concentrations strip this coating over time, making the screen feel sticky and attracting fingerprints even faster. Distilled water avoids the mineral deposits that tap water leaves behind, which show up as tiny white spots on dark screens. Wiping in one direction rather than circles is more effective because it pushes oils and particles off the edge of the screen instead of redistributing them.

## Tips

- Never spray any liquid directly onto a tablet screen. Liquid can seep into the gap between the screen and the bezel, damaging the display or internal components.
- Clean your tablet screen once a week if you use it daily. If you share the device with kids, clean it more often -- children's hands transfer more oils and residue than adult hands.
- Avoid using higher alcohol concentrations. The 70% solution diluted further with water is intentional. Undiluted 70% alcohol, or 90-99% concentrations, will degrade the oleophobic coating within a few cleanings.
- For e-readers with matte screen protectors or anti-glare films, use plain distilled water only. The alcohol can cloud or warp certain screen protector materials.
- Keep a small microfiber cloth in your tablet case for quick dry wipes between proper cleanings. A dry microfiber cloth removes most fingerprints without any solution at all.
