## Steps

1. Power off the TV or monitor and let it cool for a few minutes. A warm screen causes the cleaning solution to evaporate unevenly, leaving streaks.
2. Mix 1 cup of distilled water with 1 teaspoon of white vinegar in a spray bottle. Swirl gently to combine.
3. Spray the solution lightly onto a clean microfiber cloth. The cloth should be barely damp -- not wet.
4. Starting from the top of the screen, wipe in gentle circular motions working your way down. Apply minimal pressure. Let the cloth do the work rather than pressing hard against the panel.
5. For stubborn fingerprints or smudges, hold the damp cloth against the spot for a few seconds to soften the residue, then wipe gently.
6. Immediately follow with the second dry microfiber cloth, buffing the entire screen in the same circular pattern to remove any remaining moisture and prevent streaks.
7. Check the screen from an angle against the light to spot any missed areas before powering back on.

## Why It Works

Distilled water is the key ingredient here. Tap water contains dissolved minerals (calcium, magnesium, chlorine) that leave visible white spots when the water evaporates on a dark screen surface. Distilled water evaporates cleanly. The small amount of white vinegar provides just enough acidity to break down the oils from fingerprints and the thin film of dust that clings to screens via static charge. The vinegar concentration is intentionally low -- enough to cut grime, not enough to degrade the delicate anti-glare and oleophobic coatings that modern screens rely on. Microfiber cloths have fibers fine enough to lift particles without scratching, unlike paper towels whose wood fibers act as tiny abrasives on smooth screen surfaces.

## Tips

- If you have a premium OLED display and are cautious about the coating, skip the vinegar entirely and use plain distilled water. It handles most fingerprints on its own.
- Never use glass cleaner (like Windex), rubbing alcohol, ammonia, or acetone on screens. These chemicals strip anti-glare and oleophobic coatings permanently.
- Paper towels and tissues feel soft but are made from wood pulp fibers that scratch at the microscopic level. Over time, this creates a hazy, scratched appearance on your screen.
- Clean screens every 1-2 weeks to prevent dust buildup that dulls picture quality. You would be surprised how much brighter a freshly cleaned TV looks.
- Wash your microfiber cloths regularly with plain water (no fabric softener) to keep them effective. Fabric softener coats the fibers and reduces their ability to pick up dust and oils.
