## Steps

1. Pour 2 oz of 70% isopropyl alcohol into a clean 4 oz glass or PET plastic spray bottle. Do not use a higher concentration -- 70% is actually more effective at killing bacteria than 90% or 99% because the water content helps the alcohol penetrate cell walls.
2. Add 2 oz of distilled water.
3. Add 3 drops of tea tree essential oil if desired. Tea tree oil provides supplemental antifungal and antibacterial action.
4. Attach the spray nozzle and shake gently to combine.
5. Label with the contents, date, and "Not for porous materials."
6. To use: wash the toy first with warm water and mild unscented soap. Then spray the sanitizer evenly over all surfaces. Let it sit for 60 seconds, then rinse with clean water and air dry or pat dry with a lint-free cloth.

## Why It Works

Isopropyl alcohol at 70% concentration is the gold standard for surface disinfection. At this concentration, the water-alcohol mixture penetrates bacterial cell membranes more effectively than higher concentrations, which tend to coagulate proteins on the cell surface too quickly, forming a protective shell. The 70% solution denatures proteins and dissolves lipid membranes throughout the cell, killing bacteria, fungi, and most viruses on non-porous surfaces. Tea tree oil adds terpinen-4-ol, a compound with demonstrated activity against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus -- two organisms commonly found on inadequately cleaned intimate products. This spray works on non-porous materials (medical-grade silicone, borosilicate glass, stainless steel, ABS plastic) because these surfaces do not harbor bacteria in microscopic pores.

## Alternative

- If you prefer an alcohol-free option, mix 1 tablespoon of white vinegar with 1 cup of water in a spray bottle. This is less effective than isopropyl alcohol but adequate for routine cleaning between uses. It is not a replacement for periodic deep sanitization.
- For boilable materials (silicone without a motor, glass, stainless steel), submerging in boiling water for 3-5 minutes provides thorough sterilization without any chemicals.

## Tips

- **Non-porous materials** (medical-grade silicone, borosilicate glass, stainless steel, ABS plastic) can be fully sanitized with this spray. These are the only materials considered body-safe by health professionals.
- **Porous materials** (jelly rubber, PVC, TPE, TPR, latex, cyberskin) have microscopic pores that trap bacteria. No amount of surface cleaning fully sanitizes them. If you use products made from porous materials, use a condom over them as a barrier.
- Do not use this spray on motorized or rechargeable toys where liquid could enter the charging port or motor housing. Spray onto a cloth and wipe instead.
- The 70% isopropyl concentration is important. At 90-99%, the alcohol evaporates too quickly to effectively kill pathogens. At 70%, it maintains surface contact long enough for the denaturing reaction to complete.
- Store the spray bottle away from heat and sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol is flammable and degrades in UV light.
- Replace the batch every 3 months. Isopropyl alcohol slowly evaporates through most spray nozzles, which changes the concentration over time.
