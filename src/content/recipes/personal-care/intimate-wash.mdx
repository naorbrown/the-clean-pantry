yield: "8 oz bottle"
ingredients:
  - name: "Distilled water"
    amount: "3/4 cup"
  - name: "Unscented liquid castile soap"
    amount: "1 tbsp"
    notes: "must be unscented -- fragranced versions contain irritating essential oils"
  - name: "Pure aloe vera gel"

safetyWarnings:
  - "External use only -- never use any soap or cleanser internally"
  - "Castile soap is alkaline (pH 8-9), so heavy dilution is essential to bring the final pH down"
  - "Tea tree oil must be heavily diluted -- undiluted tea tree oil causes chemical burns on mucous membranes"
  - "Discontinue if you experience any burning, itching, or irritation"

## Steps

1. Pour 3/4 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz squeeze bottle or foaming pump bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid castile soap. The heavy dilution ratio (12:1 water to soap) is intentional -- concentrated castile soap is far too alkaline for intimate skin.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of pure aloe vera gel. This adds soothing and moisturizing properties.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of raw apple cider vinegar. This lowers the pH of the mixture from the alkaline range (castile soap is pH 8-9) toward the mildly acidic range that matches healthy vulvar skin (pH 3.8-4.5).
5. Add exactly 2 drops of tea tree essential oil. Do not exceed this amount. Tea tree oil provides broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, but at higher concentrations it irritates delicate tissue.
6. Cap the bottle and gently swirl to combine. Avoid shaking vigorously, which creates excessive foam.
7. Label with the date. Store at room temperature and use within 4-6 weeks.

## Why It Works

The vulva and vaginal area maintain an acidic pH of 3.8-4.5, which supports the growth of protective Lactobacillus bacteria and inhibits harmful organisms. Most commercial soaps and body washes have a pH of 9-10, which disrupts this acidic environment and can lead to bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, and irritation. This wash uses castile soap as its cleansing base but dilutes it heavily and acidifies the mixture with apple cider vinegar to bring the final pH closer to the body's natural range. Aloe vera provides mucopolysaccharides that soothe and hydrate skin without disrupting the acid mantle. Tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) contributes antimicrobial and antifungal compounds -- primarily terpinen-4-ol -- at a concentration low enough to be effective without causing irritation.

## Tips

- This wash is for external use on the vulva only. The vagina is self-cleaning and should never be washed with soap of any kind. Internal cleansing (douching) disrupts the vaginal microbiome and increases infection risk.
- If you have access to pH test strips, test your finished wash. Aim for pH 4.5-5.5. Add a few more drops of apple cider vinegar if the pH reads above 6.
- The wash will be very thin compared to commercial intimate washes because it contains no synthetic thickeners. This is expected and does not reduce effectiveness.
- If tea tree oil causes any tingling or discomfort, make the next batch without it. The wash works well for basic cleansing with just the diluted castile soap, aloe, and vinegar.
- Shake gently before each use, as the ingredients may separate slightly.
- Use within 4-6 weeks. The absence of synthetic preservatives means this has a shorter shelf life than commercial products.
