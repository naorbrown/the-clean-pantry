safetyWarnings:
  - "External use only -- never use any soap or cleanser internally"
  - "Castile soap is alkaline (pH 8-9), so heavy dilution is essential to bring the final pH down"
  - "Tea tree oil must be heavily diluted -- undiluted tea tree oil causes chemical burns on mucous membranes"
  - "Discontinue if you experience any burning, itching, or irritation"

## Steps

1. Pour the distilled water into a clean 8 oz squeeze or foaming pump bottle.
2. Add the unscented castile soap. The 12:1 dilution is intentional — undiluted soap is too alkaline for intimate skin.
3. Add the aloe vera gel.
4. Add the apple cider vinegar to lower pH toward the mildly acidic range (3.8-4.5).
5. Add exactly 2 drops of tea tree essential oil. Do not exceed this amount.
6. Cap and gently swirl to combine. Avoid shaking vigorously.
7. Label with the date. Use within 4-6 weeks.

## Why It Works

The vulvar area maintains an acidic pH of 3.8-4.5 that supports protective Lactobacillus bacteria. Most commercial soaps (pH 9-10) disrupt this environment, leading to infections and irritation. This wash dilutes castile soap heavily and acidifies it with ACV to match the body's natural pH. Aloe vera soothes and hydrates without disrupting the acid mantle. Tea tree oil adds antimicrobial and antifungal action at a safe concentration.

## Tips

- External use on the vulva only. Never wash internally — douching disrupts the vaginal microbiome.
- Test with pH strips if available. Aim for pH 4.5-5.5; add more ACV if above 6.
- If tea tree oil causes tingling, omit it next time. The wash works well without it.
- Shake gently before each use — ingredients may separate.
