## Steps

1. Melt the coconut oil until liquid but not hot.
2. In a clean 8 oz squeeze bottle, combine the castile soap and honey.
3. Add the melted coconut oil and vitamin E oil.
4. Add lavender essential oil if desired.
5. Cap and gently turn back and forth to combine. Avoid shaking hard.
6. Squeeze a quarter-sized amount onto a wet washcloth or loofah, lather, and rinse.

## Why It Works

Castile soap lifts dirt and oil without sulfates. Raw honey is a humectant that draws moisture from the air into skin, preventing post-wash tightness. Coconut oil replenishes the skin's moisture barrier. Vitamin E conditions skin and slows rancidity, extending shelf life.

## Alternative

- Replace honey with 1 tablespoon of pure aloe vera gel for a vegan version. Aloe provides similar humectant properties and adds soothing benefits for irritated skin.
- Swap lavender essential oil for peppermint (8 drops) for an invigorating morning body wash. Peppermint creates a mild cooling sensation on the skin.
- For very dry skin, increase coconut oil to 2 teaspoons. The body wash will be slightly thinner but more moisturizing.

## Tips

- Shake gently before each use, as honey and oil may separate.
- In cold weather, run the bottle under warm water if the coconut oil solidifies.
- Use within 2-3 months (vitamin E extends shelf life to about 3 months).
