## Steps

1. Melt 1 teaspoon of coconut oil by placing it in a small bowl over warm water or microwaving for 10 seconds. It should be liquid but not hot.
2. In a clean 8 oz squeeze bottle, combine 1/2 cup of liquid castile soap and 1 tablespoon of raw honey.
3. Add the melted coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon of vitamin E oil.
4. Add 10 drops of lavender essential oil if desired.
5. Cap the bottle and gently turn it back and forth to combine. Avoid shaking hard, which creates excessive foam.
6. To use, squeeze a quarter-sized amount onto a wet washcloth or loofah and lather over damp skin. Rinse thoroughly.

## Why It Works

Castile soap provides the cleansing base -- its plant-oil-derived surfactants lift dirt and oil from skin without the sulfates found in commercial body washes. Raw honey is a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture from the air into your skin, preventing the tight, dry feeling common with soap-only washes. Coconut oil adds a thin layer of fatty acids (primarily lauric acid) that replenish the skin's natural moisture barrier. Vitamin E oil acts as both a skin conditioner and a natural antioxidant that slows rancidity, extending the shelf life of the coconut oil in the formula.

## Alternative

- Replace honey with 1 tablespoon of pure aloe vera gel for a vegan version. Aloe provides similar humectant properties and adds soothing benefits for irritated skin.
- Swap lavender essential oil for peppermint (8 drops) for an invigorating morning body wash. Peppermint creates a mild cooling sensation on the skin.
- For very dry skin, increase coconut oil to 2 teaspoons. The body wash will be slightly thinner but more moisturizing.

## Tips

- This body wash is thinner than commercial products because it contains no synthetic thickeners. The consistency does not affect cleaning performance.
- Shake gently before each use, as the honey and oil may settle or separate.
- Store at room temperature. In cold weather, the coconut oil may solidify slightly -- run the bottle under warm water for a minute to re-liquify.
- Use within 2-3 months. Without synthetic preservatives, the shelf life is shorter than store-bought body wash. Adding vitamin E oil extends this to about 3 months.
