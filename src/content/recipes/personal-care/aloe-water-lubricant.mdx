## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of distilled water into a clean glass bowl. Distilled water is essential -- tap water contains minerals and microorganisms that shorten shelf life and can introduce bacteria.
2. Sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon of xanthan gum over the surface of the water. Let it sit for 30 seconds, then whisk vigorously with a small whisk or fork for 1-2 minutes until no clumps remain. The mixture will thicken noticeably.
3. Add 1/4 cup of pure aloe vera gel. Stir gently until fully combined. The mixture should have a smooth, slippery consistency similar to commercial lubricant.
4. If using, stir in 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil.
5. Transfer to a clean squeeze bottle or pump bottle using a small funnel.
6. Label with the date and store in the refrigerator. Use within 2-3 weeks.

## Why It Works

Aloe vera gel is naturally rich in polysaccharides -- long sugar molecules that create a slippery, viscous texture when hydrated. These polysaccharides mimic the body's own cervical mucus in consistency and pH (aloe vera gel is typically pH 4.5, close to vaginal pH of 3.8-4.5). Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide produced by bacterial fermentation that acts as a thickening and stabilizing agent. Even a tiny amount dramatically increases viscosity, giving the lubricant body and staying power that plain aloe gel lacks. Because both ingredients are water-soluble, this lubricant is fully compatible with all condom materials (latex, polyisoprene, polyurethane, nitrile) and all toy materials including silicone.

## Tips

- The most common mistake is using aloe vera gel that contains additives. Read the label: the ingredient list should be almost entirely aloe vera. Avoid products containing alcohol (drying), fragrance, parabens, propylene glycol, or artificial colors. Brands marketed for sunburn relief often contain these additives.
- If the mixture is too thick, add distilled water 1 teaspoon at a time. If too thin, sprinkle in a tiny pinch more xanthan gum and whisk well.
- Xanthan gum clumps aggressively if added to liquid too quickly. Sprinkle it slowly and whisk immediately.
- Make small batches. Without synthetic preservatives (like the parabens and phenoxyethanol found in commercial products), this lubricant has a limited shelf life. A 4 oz batch should last about 2-3 weeks refrigerated.
- The cool temperature from refrigeration can actually be pleasant, but if you prefer warmth, squeeze a small amount into your palm and warm it between your hands before use.
- This is the latex-safe alternative to the coconut oil lubricant. If condom compatibility is not a concern, the coconut oil version lasts longer and does not require refrigeration.
