## Steps

1. Pour the distilled water into a clean glass bowl. (Distilled is essential — tap water shortens shelf life.)
2. Sprinkle the xanthan gum over the water. Let sit 30 seconds, then whisk vigorously for 1-2 minutes until clump-free and thickened.
3. Add the aloe vera gel and stir until smooth and slippery.
4. Stir in vitamin E oil if using.
5. Transfer to a clean squeeze or pump bottle.
6. Label with the date and refrigerate. Use within 2-3 weeks.

## Why It Works

Aloe vera's polysaccharides create a slippery texture that mimics the body's natural lubrication, with a similar pH (4.5 vs. vaginal pH of 3.8-4.5). Xanthan gum thickens and stabilizes the mixture, giving it body that plain aloe gel lacks. Both ingredients are water-soluble, making this lubricant compatible with all condom materials and all toy materials including silicone.

## Tips

- Check aloe vera labels carefully. Avoid products with alcohol, fragrance, parabens, or artificial colors. Sunburn-relief brands often contain irritating additives.
- Too thick? Add distilled water 1 tsp at a time. Too thin? Add a tiny pinch of xanthan gum.
- Sprinkle xanthan gum slowly — it clumps aggressively if added too fast.
- Make small batches. A 4 oz batch lasts about 2-3 weeks refrigerated.
- Warm between your hands before use if you prefer it less cool.
- If condom compatibility is not needed, the coconut oil lubricant lasts longer and needs no refrigeration.
