## Steps

1. Pour 3/4 cup of isopropyl alcohol (91% concentration or higher) into a clean mixing bowl.
2. Add 1/4 cup of pure aloe vera gel. Use genuine aloe vera gel -- check the ingredient list and avoid products with added thickeners, fragrance, or dye.
3. Add 5 drops of tea tree essential oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil if desired.
4. Stir with a clean spoon until fully combined. The mixture should be a smooth, pourable gel consistency.
5. Transfer the sanitizer into a clean squeeze bottle or pump bottle using a small funnel.
6. To use, apply a dime-sized amount to one palm and rub hands together thoroughly, covering all surfaces including between fingers and around nails, until hands feel dry (about 20 seconds).

## Why It Works

Alcohol at concentrations of 60% or above denatures the proteins in bacteria and viruses, effectively destroying them on contact. The 3-to-1 ratio of 91% isopropyl alcohol to aloe vera gel ensures the final product remains above the 60% alcohol threshold needed for efficacy. The aloe vera serves as a carrier that gives the sanitizer a gel consistency, prevents it from dripping off hands, and moisturizes skin to counteract the drying effect of the alcohol. Tea tree oil provides a modest additional antimicrobial layer.

The critical factor is alcohol concentration. Using rubbing alcohol below 91% or adding too much aloe vera will dilute the final product below the 60% threshold, rendering it ineffective. This is the most common mistake in homemade sanitizer recipes.

## Tips

- Label the bottle with the date it was made. The sanitizer remains effective for about 6 months in a sealed container, after which the alcohol begins to evaporate and the concentration drops.
- Do not substitute witch hazel, vodka, or other lower-alcohol liquids for the isopropyl alcohol. Standard 80-proof vodka is only 40% alcohol, which is below the effective threshold.
- If the consistency is too thick, add a small splash of alcohol. If too thin, add a bit more aloe vera -- but always err on the side of more alcohol to maintain efficacy.
- Carry a small 2 oz bottle in your bag for use when soap and water are not available.
- Hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds is always more effective than sanitizer. Use sanitizer as a backup, not a replacement.

## Alternative

For a spray-format sanitizer (no gel), combine 3/4 cup isopropyl alcohol (91%) with 1/4 cup distilled water and 10 drops of essential oil in a small spray bottle. Mist both hands thoroughly and rub together until dry. The spray version absorbs faster and does not leave a sticky residue, making it convenient for frequent use. The tradeoff is that it dries hands more quickly because it lacks the moisturizing aloe vera.
