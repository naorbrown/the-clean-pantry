## Steps

1. Pour the isopropyl alcohol (91%+) into a clean mixing bowl.
2. Add the aloe vera gel. Use genuine aloe — avoid products with thickeners, fragrance, or dye.
3. Add tea tree and lavender essential oils if desired.
4. Stir until smooth and combined.
5. Transfer into a squeeze or pump bottle using a small funnel.
6. Apply a dime-sized amount and rub hands together, covering all surfaces, until dry (about 20 seconds).

## Why It Works

Alcohol above 60% denatures proteins in bacteria and viruses on contact. The 3-to-1 ratio of 91% isopropyl alcohol to aloe vera gel keeps the final product above that threshold. Aloe vera gives gel consistency and moisturizes skin. Tea tree oil adds a modest antimicrobial layer.

The critical factor is concentration. Using alcohol below 91% or adding too much aloe drops the final product below 60%, rendering it ineffective.

## Alternative

For a spray-format sanitizer (no gel), combine 3/4 cup isopropyl alcohol (91%) with 1/4 cup distilled water and 10 drops of essential oil in a small spray bottle. Mist both hands thoroughly and rub together until dry. The spray version absorbs faster and does not leave a sticky residue, making it convenient for frequent use. The tradeoff is that it dries hands more quickly because it lacks the moisturizing aloe vera.
## Tips

- Label with the date. Effective for about 6 months sealed; alcohol evaporates over time.
- Do not substitute vodka or witch hazel — standard 80-proof vodka is only 40% alcohol, well below the effective threshold.
- Too thick? Add a splash of alcohol. Too thin? Add aloe — but err toward more alcohol.
- Soap and water for 20 seconds is always more effective. Use sanitizer as a backup.
