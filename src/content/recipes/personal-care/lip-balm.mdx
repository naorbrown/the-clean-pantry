## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler: glass measuring cup inside a saucepan with 1-2 inches of simmering water.
2. Melt the beeswax pellets, stirring occasionally (about 5 minutes).
3. Add the coconut oil and shea butter. Stir until fully melted and combined.
4. Remove from heat, cool 1 minute, then stir in vitamin E oil and peppermint oil if using.
5. Pour quickly into lip balm tubes or tins — beeswax solidifies within minutes.
6. Let sit undisturbed for 20-30 minutes until solid.
7. Cap and label with the date.

## Why It Works

Beeswax forms a breathable barrier that locks in moisture without sealing lips completely. Coconut oil softens the wax and adds mild antimicrobial properties. Shea butter penetrates the thin lip skin to nourish beneath the surface.

## Alternative

- For a vegan version, replace beeswax with candelilla wax. Use half the amount (1 tablespoon) since candelilla wax is much harder than beeswax.
- Swap peppermint oil for vanilla extract (1/4 teaspoon) for a warm, sweet scent without the cooling effect.
- Replace shea butter with cocoa butter for a firmer balm with a subtle chocolate aroma.

## Tips

- Dedicate a glass measuring cup to lip balm making — beeswax is very hard to clean once solid.
- Test consistency before pouring: dip a spoon, let it cool 30 seconds. Too hard? Add coconut oil. Too soft? Add beeswax.
- Store in a cool, dry place. Keeps 1-2 years.
- Grainy texture means shea butter cooled unevenly. Remelt and cool in the refrigerator to fix.
