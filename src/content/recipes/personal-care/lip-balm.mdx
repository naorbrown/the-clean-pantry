## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a heat-safe glass measuring cup or small bowl inside a saucepan with 1-2 inches of simmering water.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of beeswax pellets to the glass container. Stir occasionally until fully melted (about 5 minutes).
3. Add 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon of shea butter. Stir until everything is melted and combined into a clear liquid.
4. Remove from heat. Let the mixture cool for about 1 minute, then stir in 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil and 5 drops of peppermint essential oil if using.
5. Quickly pour the liquid into lip balm tubes or small tins. Work fast -- beeswax begins to solidify within a few minutes.
6. Let the balms sit undisturbed at room temperature for 20-30 minutes until completely solid.
7. Cap the tubes or tins and label with the date.

## Why It Works

Beeswax is the structural ingredient that gives lip balm its firm texture. It forms a breathable protective barrier on the lips that locks in moisture without completely sealing the skin, which would cause the lips to stop producing their own moisture. Coconut oil softens the wax and delivers lauric acid, a fatty acid with mild antimicrobial properties. Shea butter is rich in vitamins A, E, and F and provides deep moisturization, penetrating the thin lip skin to nourish beneath the surface layer. Together, these three ingredients replicate what commercial lip balms achieve with petroleum jelly and synthetic emollients, but with plant-based fats the body recognizes and absorbs readily.

## Alternative

- For a vegan version, replace beeswax with candelilla wax. Use half the amount (1 tablespoon) since candelilla wax is much harder than beeswax.
- Swap peppermint oil for vanilla extract (1/4 teaspoon) for a warm, sweet scent without the cooling effect.
- Replace shea butter with cocoa butter for a firmer balm with a subtle chocolate aroma.

## Tips

- Beeswax is very difficult to clean once it solidifies. Dedicate a glass measuring cup to lip balm making, or line surfaces with parchment paper to catch drips.
- Test the consistency before pouring the whole batch. Dip the tip of a spoon into the melted mixture and let it cool for 30 seconds. If it feels too hard, add a bit more coconut oil. If too soft, add more beeswax.
- Store finished balms in a cool, dry place. They keep for 1-2 years thanks to the natural preservative properties of beeswax and vitamin E.
- If the balm feels grainy after cooling, the shea butter cooled unevenly. This is cosmetic only and does not affect performance. To fix it, remelt the batch and cool it more quickly by placing tubes in the refrigerator.
