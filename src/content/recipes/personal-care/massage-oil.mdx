## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of sweet almond oil (or jojoba oil) into a clean, dry 4 oz glass bottle. Dark amber or cobalt glass protects the oils from UV degradation.
2. **For the relaxing blend:** Add 10 drops of lavender essential oil and 5 drops of ylang-ylang essential oil. Skip the cinnamon and ginger.
3. **For the warming blend:** Add 3 drops of cinnamon bark essential oil and 4 drops of ginger essential oil. Skip the lavender and ylang-ylang. Do not exceed 3 drops of cinnamon -- it is a potent skin sensitizer at higher concentrations.
4. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vitamin E oil to either blend. This slows oxidation of the carrier oil and extends shelf life.
5. Cap the bottle and roll it gently between your palms for 30 seconds to blend. Do not shake vigorously.
6. Let the blend rest for at least 1 hour before first use so the essential oils fully integrate with the carrier oil.
7. Label with the blend type and date.

## Why It Works

Carrier oils provide the slip and glide needed for massage while delivering fatty acids that nourish the skin. Sweet almond oil is rich in oleic acid (a monounsaturated omega-9 fat) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fat), both of which penetrate the upper layers of skin to soften and moisturize without leaving a heavy residue. Jojoba oil is technically a liquid wax ester that closely mimics the skin's own sebum, making it an excellent choice for people with sensitive or acne-prone skin. In the warming blend, cinnamon bark oil contains cinnamaldehyde, which stimulates blood flow to the skin surface and creates a gentle warming sensation. Ginger oil contains zingiberene, which has similar vasodilating effects. In the relaxing blend, lavender's linalool and linalyl acetate are well-documented for promoting relaxation through both dermal absorption and aromatherapy. Ylang-ylang adds floral depth and its own mild sedative properties.

## Tips

- Choose your blend based on the desired effect. The warming blend is stimulating and invigorating, while the relaxing blend is calming and suited for winding down.
- To warm the oil before use, place the bottle in a bowl of hot (not boiling) water for 2-3 minutes. Never microwave essential oil blends.
- Sweet almond oil does stain sheets and clothing. Lay down a dedicated towel or sheet. Jojoba oil stains less because it is a wax rather than a true oil.
- The warming blend produces a subtle heat, not an intense burn. If the sensation is too strong, you have used too much cinnamon oil. Dilute immediately by applying more plain carrier oil.
- Store in a cool, dark place. Sweet almond oil keeps 6-9 months; jojoba oil keeps up to 2 years due to its wax ester stability.
- Do not apply this massage oil to broken skin, sunburned areas, or mucous membranes. It is designed for intact skin on the body -- back, shoulders, legs, arms, and feet.
