## Steps

1. If the coconut oil is solid, soften it by placing the jar in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes. You want it soft but not fully liquid.
2. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Stir to blend evenly.
3. Add 3 tablespoons of softened coconut oil to the dry mixture and stir until you have a smooth, creamy paste.
4. For scent, stir in 5-10 drops of essential oil (tea tree, lavender, or cedarwood work well).
5. Transfer the paste into a small jar or an empty deodorant tube.
6. To apply, scoop a pea-sized amount with your fingertips and smooth it onto clean, dry underarms.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes the acidic waste produced by odor-causing bacteria on the skin, stopping smell at its source. Cornstarch absorbs moisture throughout the day, keeping underarms dry. Coconut oil has mild antimicrobial properties from its lauric acid content and serves as the carrier that makes the paste smooth and easy to apply.

## Alternative

If baking soda irritates your skin, replace it entirely with arrowroot powder or additional cornstarch. The deodorant will rely more on moisture absorption than odor neutralization but still performs well for mild to moderate activity levels. You can also add a few drops of tea tree oil for its natural antibacterial effect.

## Tips

- Coconut oil melts at about 76 degrees F (24 degrees C). In warm weather, store the deodorant in the refrigerator to keep it firm.
- Allow a one- to two-week adjustment period when switching from commercial antiperspirant. Your body may sweat more at first as it recalibrates.
- Apply after showering on fully dry skin for the best results.
