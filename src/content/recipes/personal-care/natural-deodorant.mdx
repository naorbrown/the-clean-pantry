## Steps

1. Soften the coconut oil in a bowl of warm water until soft but not liquid.
2. Combine the baking soda and cornstarch in a small bowl.
3. Stir in the softened coconut oil until a smooth paste forms.
4. Stir in 5-10 drops of essential oil (tea tree, lavender, or cedarwood).
5. Transfer into a small jar or empty deodorant tube.
6. Apply a pea-sized amount to clean, dry underarms.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes the acidic waste from odor-causing bacteria. Cornstarch absorbs moisture throughout the day. Coconut oil carries the paste and adds mild antimicrobial action.

## Alternative

If baking soda irritates your skin, replace it entirely with arrowroot powder or additional cornstarch. The deodorant will rely more on moisture absorption than odor neutralization but still performs well for mild to moderate activity levels. You can also add a few drops of tea tree oil for its natural antibacterial effect.

## Tips

- In warm weather, refrigerate to keep the deodorant firm (coconut oil melts at 76 F).
- Allow a one- to two-week adjustment period when switching from commercial antiperspirant.
