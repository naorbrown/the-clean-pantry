## Steps

1. Fill a basin or large bowl with 1 gallon of warm water. The temperature should feel comfortably hot on your inner wrist -- aim for around 100-105°F (38-40°C).
2. Add 1/2 cup of Epsom salt and 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the water. Stir with your hand until fully dissolved.
3. Add 5 drops of peppermint essential oil and 3 drops of tea tree essential oil. Swirl the water gently to disperse.
4. If using, drizzle in 1 teaspoon of olive oil for added skin softening.
5. Submerge your feet in the basin and soak for 15-20 minutes. Top off with warm water if it cools too much.
6. Remove your feet and pat dry thoroughly with a clean towel, paying attention to the spaces between your toes.
7. Apply a thick moisturizer or natural foot cream to your feet while the skin is still slightly damp to lock in hydration.

## Why It Works

Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate, and when dissolved in warm water, it creates a hypertonic solution that draws fluid from swollen tissues through osmosis, reducing puffiness in tired feet. Magnesium ions are also absorbed through the skin in small amounts, which can help relax muscle tension. Baking soda raises the pH of the water slightly, softening rough callused skin and making it easier to exfoliate afterward. Peppermint essential oil contains menthol, which activates cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin, producing a cooling sensation that counteracts aching and overheating. Tea tree oil provides antifungal protection, addressing the warm moist environment between toes where fungal growth commonly starts.

## Tips

- For an extra-softening soak, add 1/4 cup of whole milk. The lactic acid in milk gently dissolves dead skin cells.
- Do not soak for longer than 20 minutes. Extended soaking oversaturates the skin and can actually cause more dryness once the moisture evaporates.
- Use this soak 2-3 times per week during periods of heavy activity or foot fatigue. Daily use is unnecessary for most people.
- Follow the soak with a pumice stone on callused areas while the skin is still soft. The combination of soaking and mechanical exfoliation is far more effective than either alone.
