## Steps

1. Fill a basin with 1 gallon of warm water (100-105°F / 38-40°C).
2. Add the Epsom salt and baking soda. Stir until dissolved.
3. Add the peppermint and tea tree essential oils. Swirl to disperse.
4. Drizzle in olive oil if using.
5. Soak feet for 15-20 minutes. Top off with warm water if it cools.
6. Pat dry thoroughly, especially between toes.
7. Apply a thick moisturizer while skin is still slightly damp.

## Why It Works

Dissolved Epsom salt draws fluid from swollen tissues through osmosis, reducing puffiness. Magnesium absorbed through the skin helps relax muscle tension. Baking soda softens callused skin for easier exfoliation. Peppermint oil produces a cooling sensation that counteracts aching. Tea tree oil provides antifungal protection where fungal growth commonly starts.

## Tips

- For extra softening, add 1/4 cup of whole milk. Lactic acid dissolves dead skin cells.
- Do not soak longer than 20 minutes — oversaturated skin dries out faster afterward.
- Use 2-3 times per week during heavy activity. Daily use is unnecessary.
- Follow with a pumice stone on callused areas while skin is still soft.
