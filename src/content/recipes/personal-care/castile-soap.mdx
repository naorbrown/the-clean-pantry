safetyWarnings:
  - "Lye (sodium hydroxide) is caustic and will burn skin and eyes on contact. Always wear safety goggles, long rubber gloves, and long sleeves."
  - "Always add lye to water, never water to lye. Adding water to lye causes a violent exothermic reaction that can splash and boil over."
  - "Work in a well-ventilated area or outdoors. The lye-water mixture releases fumes for the first 1–2 minutes that irritate the throat and lungs."
  - "Keep white vinegar nearby to neutralize any lye splashes on countertops (not on skin — flush skin with running water for 15 minutes)."
  - "Keep children and pets out of the workspace until cleanup is complete."

## Steps

1. **Prepare your workspace.** Cover your countertop with newspaper or a silicone mat. Set out your mold — a silicone loaf mold works well, or line a cardboard box with parchment paper. Put on safety goggles, rubber gloves, and long sleeves before handling lye.

2. **Make the lye solution.** Measure 10 oz of distilled water into a heat-safe glass or HDPE plastic pitcher. Slowly pour 4.1 oz of lye into the water while stirring gently with a silicone spatula. The mixture will heat up to around 200°F (93°C) and release fumes — do this near an open window or outside. Stir until the lye is fully dissolved and the liquid turns clear. Set aside to cool to about 100–110°F (38–43°C), which takes 30–60 minutes.

3. **Warm the olive oil.** Measure 32 oz of extra virgin olive oil into a large stainless steel or enamel pot. Gently warm it on the stove to about 100–110°F (38–43°C). You want the oil and lye solution at roughly the same temperature.

4. **Combine and blend.** Slowly pour the cooled lye solution into the warm olive oil in a thin stream, stirring continuously. Switch to an immersion blender (stick blender) and blend in short 20–30 second bursts, stirring by hand in between. You are looking for "trace" — the point where the mixture thickens enough that a drizzle from the blender leaves a visible trail on the surface, like thin pudding. This can take 10–20 minutes with a stick blender. Pure olive oil soap reaches trace more slowly than recipes with coconut or palm oil.

5. **Add fragrance (optional).** Once you hit a light trace, stir in 1 oz of essential oil by hand. Lavender is classic. Tea tree adds antimicrobial properties. Peppermint gives a cooling tingle. Stir thoroughly for 30 seconds.

6. **Pour into the mold.** Pour the batter into your prepared mold. Tap the mold gently against the counter to release air bubbles. Smooth the top with a spatula.

7. **Insulate and wait.** Cover the mold with a piece of cardboard, then wrap the whole thing in a towel. This keeps the heat in and allows saponification to complete. Let it sit undisturbed for 24–48 hours. The soap will go through a "gel phase" where the center becomes translucent and warm — this is normal.

8. **Unmold and cut.** After 24–48 hours, remove the soap from the mold. If it is still very soft, wait another day. Cut into bars with a sharp knife — aim for bars about 1 inch thick.

9. **Cure.** Place bars on a wire rack or parchment-lined tray with space between them for airflow. Cure in a cool, dry place for **4–6 weeks**, flipping the bars every week. Pure olive oil soap (called "Castile" or "bastille" depending on the recipe) benefits from an especially long cure — some soap makers cure it for 6–12 months for the hardest, mildest bar possible. The minimum is 4 weeks.

## Why It Works

True castile soap is made through saponification — the chemical reaction between a fat (olive oil's triglycerides) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide). During saponification, the lye breaks the triglyceride molecules apart and recombines the fatty acids with sodium ions, creating soap molecules and glycerin as a byproduct. By the end of the cure, zero lye remains in the finished bar — it has all been consumed by the reaction. The glycerin stays in the bar (unlike commercial soap manufacturing, which strips it out to sell separately), making homemade soap naturally moisturizing.

Olive oil produces a soap that is exceptionally gentle because oleic acid (the dominant fatty acid in olive oil) creates a mild, conditioning lather. The tradeoff is that pure olive oil soap lathers less than soaps that include coconut or palm oil, and it takes longer to harden during cure. The long cure time allows excess water to evaporate, making the bar harder and longer-lasting.

## Alternative

- **Add coconut oil for more lather.** Replace 20% of the olive oil with coconut oil (25.6 oz olive oil + 6.4 oz coconut oil) and adjust lye to 4.5 oz. Coconut oil produces big, bubbly lather but can be drying above 20%. This recipe requires a lye calculator to verify the exact lye amount — never guess with lye quantities.
- **Liquid castile soap.** To make liquid soap instead of bar soap, substitute potassium hydroxide (KOH) for sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The process is similar but requires different ratios and produces a soap paste that you dilute with water. This is more advanced and takes longer.
- **Rebatch shortcut.** If you want to skip the lye handling entirely, buy a plain unscented castile soap bar, grate it, melt it in a double boiler with a splash of water, add your essential oils, and remold. This is not truly "from scratch" but avoids all lye safety concerns.

## Tips

- **Always run your recipe through a lye calculator** (search for "soap lye calculator") before starting. Different oils require different amounts of lye. The amounts in this recipe are specific to 100% olive oil. Changing the oil blend without recalculating the lye can result in a bar that is lye-heavy (caustic) or oil-heavy (soft and rancid).
- Never use aluminum, tin, or non-stick pots for soap making. Lye reacts with aluminum and damages non-stick coatings. Use stainless steel, enamel, or heat-safe HDPE plastic.
- If the mixture does not reach trace after 20 minutes of stick blending, keep going — pure olive oil soap is notoriously slow to trace. Some batches take 30+ minutes. Do not give up and pour too early, or the lye and oil may separate in the mold.
- The soap is safe to use when it no longer feels "zappy" on the tongue (touch a tiny wet corner to the tip of your tongue — if it zaps like a battery, it needs more cure time). A pH strip should read between 8 and 10.
- Store cured bars in a cool, dry place. Homemade castile soap lasts 1–2 years. Use a draining soap dish to extend bar life — sitting in water makes any bar soap soft and slimy.
- This recipe makes a white to pale yellow bar. For color, add 1 teaspoon of natural colorant at trace: turmeric (golden), spirulina (green), cocoa powder (brown), or activated charcoal (black).
