## Steps

1. **Prepare the cloths:** If using yardage, wash the cotton flannel in hot water with no detergent to pre-shrink and remove any sizing. Dry completely, then cut into 12 squares approximately 7 inches by 7 inches. If the edges fray, use pinking shears or sew a simple rolled hem.
2. **Mix the cleansing solution:** In a clean glass jar or bowl, combine 1 cup of distilled water, 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel, and 1 tablespoon of pure aloe vera gel. Stir until the aloe is fully dissolved.
3. Add 2 drops of lavender essential oil if desired. Stir to disperse.
4. **Soak the wipes:** Roll or fold the flannel squares and arrange them in a clean, wide-mouth glass jar or airtight container. Pour the cleansing solution over the cloths until they are damp but not dripping.
5. Seal the container and store at room temperature. The wipes are ready to use immediately.
6. **After use:** Place used wipes in a small wet bag or dedicated hamper. Wash in hot water with a gentle, unscented detergent. Dry on high heat. Do not reuse a wipe without washing it first.
7. **Refresh the solution** every 2-3 days by discarding any remaining liquid, rinsing the jar, and mixing a fresh batch.

## Why It Works

Witch hazel is a natural astringent containing tannins that gently cleanse and tone skin without stripping its natural oils. The alcohol-free formulation is critical because ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are drying and irritating to delicate intimate tissue, whereas the tannins in witch hazel provide antimicrobial action through a different mechanism -- they bind to bacterial surface proteins and disrupt cell membrane function. Aloe vera contributes polysaccharides that soothe inflammation and create a thin hydrating film on the skin. Cotton flannel is soft, absorbent, and becomes softer with each wash, making it gentle enough for daily use on sensitive skin. Unlike disposable wipes, which sit in landfills for decades and often contain methylisothiazolinone and other preservatives linked to contact dermatitis, these reusable cloths reduce waste and eliminate chemical exposure.

## Tips

- Cotton flannel is the best fabric choice. It is soft, absorbent, and durable enough to survive hundreds of hot-water wash cycles. Avoid microfiber, which can feel scratchy on intimate skin and sheds microplastics.
- Pre-cut flannel squares are available at fabric stores, often marketed as "unpaper towels" or "reusable wipes." These save cutting time.
- Keep two sets of wipes (24 total) so you always have clean ones available while the used set is in the laundry.
- A small zippered wet bag (sold for cloth diapers) is the most convenient way to store used wipes until laundry day.
- If you skip the lavender oil, the wipes have essentially no scent, which many people prefer for intimate use.
- These wipes are for external cleansing only. Do not use them internally.
- The solution recipe scales easily. Double or triple it for larger batches.
