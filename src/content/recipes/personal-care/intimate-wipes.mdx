## Steps

1. **Prepare the cloths:** Wash cotton flannel in hot water (no detergent) to pre-shrink. Dry completely, then cut into 12 squares (~7x7 inches). Use pinking shears if edges fray.
2. **Mix the solution:** Combine the distilled water, witch hazel, and aloe vera gel in a clean glass jar. Stir until aloe dissolves.
3. Add lavender essential oil if desired. Stir to disperse.
4. **Soak the wipes:** Arrange folded flannel in an airtight container. Pour solution over cloths until damp but not dripping.
5. Seal and store at room temperature. Ready to use immediately.
6. **After use:** Wash in hot water with unscented detergent. Dry on high heat. Never reuse without washing.
7. **Refresh the solution** every 2-3 days.

## Why It Works

Witch hazel tannins cleanse and tone skin without stripping natural oils. The alcohol-free formulation is critical — ethanol irritates delicate intimate tissue. Aloe vera soothes inflammation and creates a hydrating film. Cotton flannel is soft, absorbent, and gets softer with each wash. Unlike disposable wipes, these eliminate preservatives linked to contact dermatitis and reduce landfill waste.

## Tips

- Cotton flannel is the best choice. Avoid microfiber, which feels scratchy and sheds microplastics.
- Pre-cut squares are available at fabric stores, often marketed as "unpaper towels."
- Keep two sets (24 total) so clean wipes are always available during laundry.
- A zippered wet bag (sold for cloth diapers) stores used wipes until laundry day.
- External cleansing only. The solution scales easily for larger batches.
