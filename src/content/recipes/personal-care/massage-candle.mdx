## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler: glass measuring cup inside a saucepan with 1-2 inches of simmering water.
2. Melt the soy wax flakes, stirring occasionally (about 5 minutes).
3. Add the shea butter and coconut oil. Stir until melted and combined.
4. Remove from heat. Add the sweet almond oil and stir.
5. Cool to ~140°F, then stir in the essential oil blend. (Cooler wax prevents volatile compounds from evaporating.)
6. Place the wick in the center of a 6 oz tin. Use a wick centering device or pencil to hold it in place.
7. Pour the mixture slowly into the container, keeping the wick centered. Fill to 1/4 inch below the rim.
8. Cool undisturbed for 2-3 hours until solid. Do not move or bump during cooling.
9. Trim wick to 1/4 inch. Label with date and ingredients.

## Why It Works

Soy wax melts at ~120°F — far lower than paraffin (130-150°F) or beeswax (144-149°F). Blending it with shea butter, coconut oil, and almond oil lowers the pool temperature further to 105-115°F, comfortable for skin contact. Shea butter provides vitamins A and E. Coconut oil absorbs rapidly into skin. Sweet almond oil gives the long-lasting slip needed for massage.

## Tips

- First burn: let the entire surface liquefy (~30-45 minutes) to prevent tunneling.
- To use, blow out the candle and wait 30-60 seconds. Test on your inner wrist before applying.
- A rough or frosted surface after cooling is normal for soy wax.
- Do not exceed 15 drops of essential oil per 6 oz candle.
- Store with a lid. Fragrance fades after about 6 months.
- This is not a lubricant — not compatible with latex condoms or mucous membranes.
