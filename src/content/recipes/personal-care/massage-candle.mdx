## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a heat-safe glass measuring cup or metal pouring pot inside a saucepan with 1-2 inches of simmering water.
2. Add 3 oz of soy wax flakes to the glass container. Stir occasionally until fully melted, about 5 minutes. The wax will turn from opaque white to clear liquid.
3. Add 1 oz of shea butter and 1 oz of coconut oil. Stir until completely melted and combined.
4. Remove the double boiler from heat. Add 1 oz of sweet almond oil and stir to combine.
5. Let the mixture cool to approximately 140°F (use a thermometer if available -- the mixture should be warm but not hot). Stir in 15 drops of your chosen essential oil blend. Adding essential oils to cooler wax prevents the volatile compounds from evaporating.
6. While the wax cools, prepare the container. Place the pre-tabbed cotton wick in the center of a 6 oz tin or heat-safe ceramic vessel. Use a wick centering device or rest a pencil across the top of the tin with the wick wrapped around it to hold it centered.
7. Slowly pour the melted mixture into the container, keeping the wick centered. Fill to about 1/4 inch below the rim.
8. Let the candle cool undisturbed at room temperature for 2-3 hours until completely solid. Do not move or bump the candle during cooling, as this causes uneven surfaces and sinkholes.
9. Trim the wick to 1/4 inch above the surface. Label with the date and ingredients.

## Why It Works

The key to a massage candle is the melt point of its wax blend. Pure soy wax melts at approximately 120°F, which is dramatically lower than paraffin wax (130-150°F) or beeswax (144-149°F). By blending soy wax with shea butter, coconut oil, and sweet almond oil -- all of which are liquid at much lower temperatures -- the resulting candle melts into a pool of warm oil at a temperature comfortable for skin contact (around 105-115°F once it flows away from the flame). Shea butter contributes vitamins A and E along with cinnamic acid, a mild UV absorber. Coconut oil adds lauric acid for antimicrobial properties and rapid skin absorption. Sweet almond oil provides the long-lasting slip and glide needed for massage. The cotton wick produces a clean, soot-free burn that does not introduce combustion byproducts into the massage oil.

## Tips

- The first burn is the most important. Let the candle burn long enough for the entire surface to liquefy (about 30-45 minutes for a 3-inch diameter tin). This prevents tunneling on future burns.
- To use as massage oil, blow out the candle and wait 30-60 seconds for the pool to cool slightly. Test a few drops on your inner wrist. It should feel pleasantly warm, not hot.
- Pour the melted pool directly onto skin, or dip your fingers in and apply by hand.
- If the candle develops a rough or frosted surface after cooling, this is normal for soy wax and does not affect performance.
- Do not add more than 15 drops of essential oil per 6 oz candle. Higher concentrations can cause skin irritation and affect burn quality.
- Store the finished candle with a lid to prevent dust from settling on the surface. Soy wax candles keep indefinitely, though the essential oil fragrance fades after about 6 months.
- This candle is not a lubricant. The oil-based composition is not compatible with latex condoms and is not formulated for use on mucous membranes.
