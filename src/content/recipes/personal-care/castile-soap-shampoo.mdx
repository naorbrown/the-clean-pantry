## Steps

1. Mix 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap with 1/2 cup of water in a squeeze bottle or small cup.
2. Wet your hair thoroughly in the shower.
3. Apply the diluted soap mixture to your scalp and massage gently with your fingertips for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse your hair completely with warm water.
5. In a separate cup, mix 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of cool water.
6. Pour the vinegar rinse over your hair, working it through from roots to ends.
7. Let it sit for 30 seconds, then rinse with cool water.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is made from saponified plant oils and cleans hair without the sulfates found in commercial shampoos that can strip natural oils. However, castile soap is alkaline, which can roughen the hair cuticle and leave a dull, waxy feel. The apple cider vinegar rinse restores the hair's naturally acidic pH, smoothing the cuticle back down so hair feels soft and looks shiny.

## Alternative

If you find castile soap too drying, try a co-wash (conditioner-only wash) using a silicone-free conditioner. Massage it into your scalp just as you would shampoo, then rinse. This works especially well for curly or coarse hair types that need extra moisture.

## Tips

- Mix the shampoo fresh each time rather than pre-mixing a large batch. Diluted castile soap can grow bacteria if stored for more than a few days.
- Your hair may go through a transition period of 2-4 weeks if you are switching from conventional shampoo. It may feel oilier or heavier than usual as your scalp adjusts.
- Use unscented castile soap if you have a sensitive scalp, or choose a peppermint variety for a refreshing tingle.
