## Steps

1. Mix the castile soap with 1/2 cup of water in a squeeze bottle or cup.
2. Wet hair thoroughly.
3. Apply to scalp and massage for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse completely with warm water.
5. Mix 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of cool water.
6. Pour the rinse over hair from roots to ends.
7. Wait 30 seconds, then rinse with cool water.

## Why It Works

Castile soap cleans hair without the sulfates that strip natural oils. Its alkaline pH can roughen the cuticle and leave a waxy feel. The apple cider vinegar rinse restores acidic pH, smoothing the cuticle so hair feels soft and looks shiny.

## Alternative

If you find castile soap too drying, try a co-wash (conditioner-only wash) using a silicone-free conditioner. Massage it into your scalp just as you would shampoo, then rinse. This works especially well for curly or coarse hair types that need extra moisture.

## Tips

- Mix fresh each time. Diluted castile soap can grow bacteria within days.
- Expect a 2-4 week transition period from conventional shampoo. Hair may feel oilier as your scalp adjusts.
- Use unscented castile soap for sensitive scalps, or peppermint for a refreshing tingle.
