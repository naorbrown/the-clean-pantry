## Steps

1. In a small jar or squeeze bottle, combine 2 tablespoons of raw honey, 1 tablespoon of jojoba oil, and 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap.
2. If using, add 3 drops of tea tree essential oil.
3. Stir or shake gently to blend. The mixture will be thick and slightly cloudy.
4. To use, wet your face with warm water. Apply a dime-sized amount to your fingertips and massage gently in circular motions for 30-60 seconds.
5. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat dry with a clean towel.
6. Follow with your usual moisturizer.

## Why It Works

Raw honey is both a mild antimicrobial and a humectant. Its natural hydrogen peroxide content (produced by the enzyme glucose oxidase) gently reduces bacteria on the skin without disrupting the acid mantle, making it effective for acne-prone skin without the harshness of salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Jojoba oil closely mimics the skin's own sebum, so it hydrates without clogging pores. The small amount of castile soap provides surfactant action to remove sunscreen, makeup residue, and environmental grime that honey and oil alone may not fully dissolve.

## Alternative

- For oily or acne-prone skin, replace jojoba oil with 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil is lighter, absorbs faster, and is high in linoleic acid, which is often deficient in acne-prone skin.
- For dry or mature skin, swap jojoba oil for rosehip seed oil, which is rich in vitamin A and essential fatty acids that support skin repair.
- For a soap-free version, omit the castile soap entirely. The honey and oil will cleanse gently on their own, though this version may not fully remove heavy sunscreen or makeup.

## Tips

- Store in the refrigerator for a shelf life of up to 4 weeks. At room temperature, use within 2 weeks.
- If the honey crystallizes (becomes grainy), run the jar under warm water until it re-liquifies. Crystallization is natural and does not mean the product has gone bad.
- Use lukewarm water, never hot. Hot water strips the skin's natural oils and can worsen dryness and irritation.
- Start with a small amount. This cleanser is concentrated -- a dime-sized portion covers the full face.
