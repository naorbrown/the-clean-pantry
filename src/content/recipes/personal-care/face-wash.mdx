## Steps

1. Combine the honey, jojoba oil, and castile soap in a small jar or squeeze bottle.
2. Add tea tree essential oil if using.
3. Stir or shake gently to blend.
4. Wet your face, massage a dime-sized amount in circular motions for 30-60 seconds.
5. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry.
6. Follow with your usual moisturizer.

## Why It Works

Raw honey is antimicrobial and a humectant, reducing bacteria without disrupting the acid mantle. Jojoba oil mimics the skin's own sebum, so it hydrates without clogging pores. Castile soap provides surfactant action to remove sunscreen, makeup, and grime that honey and oil alone may not dissolve.

## Alternative

- For oily or acne-prone skin, replace jojoba oil with 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil is lighter, absorbs faster, and is high in linoleic acid, which is often deficient in acne-prone skin.
- For dry or mature skin, swap jojoba oil for rosehip seed oil, which is rich in vitamin A and essential fatty acids that support skin repair.
- For a soap-free version, omit the castile soap entirely. The honey and oil will cleanse gently on their own, though this version may not fully remove heavy sunscreen or makeup.

## Tips

- Refrigerate for up to 4 weeks, or use within 2 weeks at room temperature.
- If the honey crystallizes, run the jar under warm water to re-liquify.
- Use lukewarm water, never hot — hot water strips natural oils and worsens dryness.
