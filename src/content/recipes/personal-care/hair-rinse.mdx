## Steps

1. Combine the ACV and distilled water in a squeeze bottle or small pitcher.
2. Add essential oils and honey if using. Shake to combine.
3. Shampoo and rinse as normal.
4. Pour the ACV mixture over scalp and hair, crown to ends. Massage into scalp for 30 seconds.
5. Let sit 1-2 minutes.
6. Rinse thoroughly with cool water.

## Why It Works

ACV's acidity (pH 2.5-3.0) dissolves mineral deposits and product buildup without stripping natural sebum. It flattens the hair cuticle so light reflects uniformly, creating visible shine. ACV's antimicrobial properties help control the yeast responsible for dandruff. Rosemary oil improves scalp circulation.

## Tips

- Mix fresh each time — essential oils degrade in water within days.
- Fine or dry hair: use 1 tbsp ACV per cup. Oily or thick hair: increase to 3 tbsp.
- The vinegar scent disappears once hair dries. If it lingers, rinse more thoroughly.
- Frequency: weekly for normal hair, twice weekly for oily, every two weeks for dry.
