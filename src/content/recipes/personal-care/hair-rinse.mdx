## Steps

1. Combine 2 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of distilled water in a squeeze bottle, small pitcher, or jar you can pour from easily.
2. If using, add 3 drops of rosemary essential oil, 2 drops of lavender essential oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of raw honey. Stir or shake to combine.
3. Shampoo your hair as normal and rinse thoroughly.
4. Tilt your head back and slowly pour the ACV mixture over your scalp and hair, working from the crown down to the ends. Massage it into your scalp with your fingertips for 30 seconds.
5. Let the rinse sit in your hair for 1-2 minutes. You will feel a slight tingling on the scalp, which is normal.
6. Rinse thoroughly with cool water. Cool water helps close the hair cuticle and maximizes the shine effect.

## Why It Works

Shampoos, conditioners, dry shampoo, and styling products leave behind residue that coats the hair shaft over time, making hair look dull, feel heavy, and resist styling. Apple cider vinegar has a pH of about 2.5-3.0, which is acidic enough to dissolve mineral deposits and product buildup without stripping the hair's natural sebum. The acidity also flattens the cuticle layer of each hair strand. When cuticles lie flat, light reflects off the hair surface more uniformly, which is what creates visible shine. The acetic acid in ACV also has mild antimicrobial properties that help control malassezia, the yeast responsible for dandruff and scalp flakiness. Rosemary oil has been shown to improve microcirculation in the scalp, delivering more nutrients to hair follicles.

## Tips

- Mix a fresh batch for each use. The essential oils degrade in water within a few days and lose their effectiveness.
- Start with a lower concentration (1 tablespoon ACV per cup of water) if you have fine or dry hair. Increase to 3 tablespoons for very oily or thick hair.
- The vinegar scent disappears completely once your hair dries. If it lingers, you used too much vinegar or did not rinse thoroughly enough.
- Use this rinse once a week for normal hair, twice weekly for oily hair, and every two weeks for dry or damaged hair.
