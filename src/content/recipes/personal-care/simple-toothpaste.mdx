## Steps

1. Melt the coconut oil (microwave 10-15 seconds or warm in a water bath).
2. Stir in the baking soda until a thick, smooth paste forms.
3. Mix in peppermint essential oil if desired.
4. Transfer to a small jar with a lid.
5. Scoop a small amount onto a wet toothbrush, brush for two minutes, and rinse.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild abrasive that scrubs plaque and surface stains without damaging enamel. Its alkaline pH neutralizes acids from oral bacteria. Coconut oil binds the paste and helps reduce harmful oral bacteria.

## Alternative

For a fluoride-free remineralizing option, replace 1 tablespoon of the baking soda with food-grade calcium carbonate powder. This adds bioavailable calcium that may help strengthen enamel over time. You can also add a tiny pinch of xylitol for sweetness and its cavity-fighting properties.

## Tips

- Store at room temperature. The paste firms up in cool weather but works the same.
- Use a small spoon to scoop paste onto your brush instead of dipping to keep the batch hygienic.
- Discuss with your dentist before switching from fluoride toothpaste.
