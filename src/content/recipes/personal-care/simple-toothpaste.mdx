## Steps

1. Melt 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a small bowl (microwave for 10-15 seconds or warm in a water bath).
2. Add 3 tablespoons of baking soda to the melted oil and stir until a thick, smooth paste forms.
3. Add 5-10 drops of peppermint essential oil if desired and mix thoroughly.
4. Transfer the paste to a small jar with a lid.
5. To use, scoop a small amount onto a wet toothbrush and brush as normal for two minutes. Rinse well.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild abrasive that physically scrubs plaque and surface stains from tooth enamel without being harsh enough to cause damage. Its alkaline pH helps neutralize the acids produced by oral bacteria, which are the primary cause of tooth decay. Coconut oil binds the paste together and contains lauric acid, which has been shown to reduce harmful oral bacteria.

## Alternative

For a fluoride-free remineralizing option, replace 1 tablespoon of the baking soda with food-grade calcium carbonate powder. This adds bioavailable calcium that may help strengthen enamel over time. You can also add a tiny pinch of xylitol for sweetness and its cavity-fighting properties.

## Tips

- Store at room temperature. The coconut oil will solidify in cooler weather, making the paste firmer. This is normal and does not affect performance.
- Use a small spoon or popsicle stick to scoop the paste onto your brush, rather than dipping the brush into the jar, to keep the batch hygienic.
- Discuss with your dentist before switching from fluoride toothpaste, especially if you are prone to cavities.
