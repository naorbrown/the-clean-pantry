## Steps

1. Scoop 1/4 cup of refined coconut oil into a clean, dry glass jar. Refined coconut oil is odorless and tasteless, unlike virgin coconut oil which has a strong coconut scent.
2. If the oil is solid (it solidifies below 76°F), place the jar in a bowl of warm water for 2-3 minutes until the oil melts completely into a clear liquid.
3. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil. This acts as an antioxidant that prevents the coconut oil from going rancid and extends shelf life to about 6 months.
4. Let the mixture cool to skin temperature before use. It will resolidify at room temperature, which is fine -- it melts instantly on contact with skin.
5. Transfer to a small jar with a tight-fitting lid. A 2 oz glass jar with a screw-top lid works well.
6. Label with the date. Store at room temperature away from direct sunlight.

## Why It Works

Coconut oil is roughly 50% lauric acid, a medium-chain fatty acid that gives it natural antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Its melting point of 76°F means it transitions from solid to liquid right around body temperature, creating a smooth, long-lasting glide without the sticky residue common in water-based lubricants. Unlike petroleum-based products, coconut oil is biocompatible with skin and mucous membranes and does not disrupt the skin's natural moisture barrier. The fat molecules are small enough to absorb gradually, so it provides lubrication for an extended period before the body metabolizes it. Vitamin E adds additional antioxidant protection for sensitive tissue.

## Tips

- Always use refined (also labeled "expeller-pressed" or "RBD") coconut oil. Unrefined/virgin coconut oil has a strong scent and flavor that many people find distracting in this context.
- Keep a dedicated jar for this purpose. Use a clean finger or small spoon each time -- do not introduce water into the jar, as moisture promotes bacterial growth in oil.
- Coconut oil melts instantly on contact with warm skin, so you can apply it in its solid state and let body heat do the work.
- If you or your partner are prone to yeast infections, monitor for any changes. While coconut oil has antifungal properties, oil-based lubricants can occasionally alter vaginal flora in sensitive individuals.
- This lubricant is not compatible with latex or polyisoprene barriers. If you need condom compatibility, use the aloe water-based lubricant instead.
- Place a towel down to protect sheets and fabrics, as oil-based lubricants will stain.
