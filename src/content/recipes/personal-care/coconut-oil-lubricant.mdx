## Steps

1. Scoop the refined coconut oil into a clean, dry glass jar.
2. If solid, place the jar in warm water for 2-3 minutes until melted.
3. Stir in the vitamin E oil.
4. Let cool to skin temperature. It resolidifies at room temperature — it melts on contact with skin.
5. Transfer to a small jar with a tight-fitting lid.
6. Label with the date. Store at room temperature away from sunlight.

## Why It Works

Coconut oil has natural antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Its 76°F melting point means it transitions from solid to liquid at body temperature, creating smooth, long-lasting glide without sticky residue. The fat molecules absorb gradually, providing lubrication for an extended period. Vitamin E adds antioxidant protection for sensitive tissue.

## Tips

- Always use refined ("expeller-pressed" or "RBD") coconut oil. Virgin has a strong scent.
- Use a clean finger or spoon each time — do not introduce water, which promotes bacterial growth.
- You can apply it solid; it melts on contact with warm skin.
- Monitor for changes if prone to yeast infections — oil-based lubricants can alter vaginal flora in sensitive individuals.
- Not compatible with latex or polyisoprene. For condom compatibility, use the aloe water-based lubricant.
- Place a towel down to protect fabrics from oil stains.
