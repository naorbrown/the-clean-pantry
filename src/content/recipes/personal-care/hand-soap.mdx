## Steps

1. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap to an empty foaming soap dispenser.
2. Add 1 teaspoon of your chosen moisturizing oil (jojoba, sweet almond, or fractionated coconut oil).
3. If using, add 5 drops of tea tree essential oil.
4. Slowly fill the rest of the dispenser with water, leaving about an inch of space at the top for the pump mechanism. Pour the water in gently to avoid creating a wall of foam.
5. Screw on the foaming pump and turn the bottle upside down once or twice to mix. Do not shake vigorously.
6. Pump 1-2 times onto wet hands, lather for at least 20 seconds, and rinse.

## Why It Works

A foaming dispenser works by mixing air into the soap solution as it pumps, producing foam without the need for synthetic foaming agents like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). The heavily diluted castile soap (roughly a 1:10 soap-to-water ratio) is the perfect concentration for foaming dispensers -- regular liquid soap is too thick and clogs the pump mechanism. The castile soap's plant-oil surfactants effectively lift bacteria, dirt, and oils from the skin. The small amount of moisturizing oil replaces the skin's natural oils that soap strips away, preventing the dry, tight feeling that comes from frequent handwashing.

## Alternative

- For an antibacterial boost without tea tree oil, use 5 drops of lavender essential oil instead. Lavender has mild antibacterial properties and a calming scent.
- Replace the moisturizing oil with 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin for a lighter feel that still prevents dryness.
- For an unscented version, omit the essential oil entirely. The castile soap alone cleans just as effectively.

## Tips

- You must use a foaming dispenser for this recipe. A regular soap pump will dispense watery liquid instead of foam because the soap-to-water ratio is too diluted for a standard pump.
- Distilled water prevents bacterial growth and extends shelf life. With distilled water, this soap lasts 2-3 months. With tap water, use within 2-3 weeks.
- Do not add vinegar to this recipe. The acid will react with the castile soap and create a greasy, curdled mess.
- This recipe saves significant money over commercial foaming soap. A single bottle of castile soap will refill a foaming dispenser dozens of times.
- For a thicker foam, increase the castile soap to 3 tablespoons per dispenser. Decrease if the pump becomes stiff or difficult to press.
