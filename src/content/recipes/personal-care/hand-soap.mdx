## Steps

1. Add the castile soap to an empty foaming soap dispenser.
2. Add the moisturizing oil.
3. Add tea tree essential oil if using.
4. Slowly fill with water, leaving an inch of space at the top. Pour gently to avoid excess foam.
5. Attach the pump and turn upside down once or twice to mix.
6. Pump 1-2 times onto wet hands, lather 20 seconds, and rinse.

## Why It Works

A foaming dispenser mixes air into the soap as it pumps, producing foam without synthetic foaming agents. The 1:10 soap-to-water ratio is ideal for foaming dispensers — undiluted soap clogs the pump. Castile soap's surfactants lift bacteria, dirt, and oils from skin. The moisturizing oil replaces natural oils that soap strips away, preventing dryness from frequent washing.

## Alternative

- For an antibacterial boost without tea tree oil, use 5 drops of lavender essential oil instead. Lavender has mild antibacterial properties and a calming scent.
- Replace the moisturizing oil with 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin for a lighter feel that still prevents dryness.
- For an unscented version, omit the essential oil entirely. The castile soap alone cleans just as effectively.

## Tips

- A foaming dispenser is required — a regular pump dispenses watery liquid at this dilution.
- Distilled water extends shelf life to 2-3 months. With tap water, use within 2-3 weeks.
- Do not add vinegar. Acid curdles castile soap into a greasy mess.
- For thicker foam, increase castile soap to 3 tablespoons. Decrease if the pump stiffens.
