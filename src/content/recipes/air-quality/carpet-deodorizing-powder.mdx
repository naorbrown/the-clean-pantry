## Steps

1. Combine the baking soda, cornstarch, and borax (if using) in a medium bowl. Stir with a fork to break up any clumps.
2. Add 20 drops of essential oil to the powder. Stir thoroughly, pressing out any oil clumps against the side of the bowl with the back of the fork.
3. Transfer the mixture to a fine mesh sifter or a mason jar with holes poked in the lid.
4. Sprinkle the powder evenly across the carpet in one room at a time. Use a light, even dusting -- you should be able to see the carpet color beneath.
5. Use a stiff brush or clean broom to gently work the powder down into the carpet fibers.
6. Let the powder sit for at least 20 minutes. For stubborn odors, leave it for 1-2 hours or overnight.
7. Vacuum slowly and thoroughly, making two passes over each section. Use overlapping strokes to ensure you pick up all the powder.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes odors through acid-base reactions with the volatile fatty acids and sulfur compounds that cause most carpet smells. Cornstarch works as a secondary absorbent -- its starch granules have a high surface area that physically traps odor molecules and moisture. Borax (sodium tetraborate) adds antimicrobial action, killing odor-producing bacteria that live deep in carpet padding. The essential oils provide immediate pleasant fragrance, but more importantly, tea tree oil (melaleuca) has demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal properties that continue working while the powder sits. Vacuuming removes the powder along with the trapped odor molecules, dust, and dead bacteria it has collected.

## Tips

- If you skip the borax, increase the baking soda to 1.5 cups to compensate for the lost absorbency.
- Do not use on wet or damp carpet. The powder will clump and become very difficult to vacuum.
- Store leftover powder in an airtight jar for up to 3 months. The essential oil scent will fade, but the deodorizing power remains.
- For pet odor specifically, use enzyme-based treatment first to break down urine proteins, then follow up with this powder after the carpet is fully dry.
- Check your vacuum bag or canister after use -- the fine powder fills it faster than normal debris.
