## How to Make It

1. Add 1 tablespoon of witch hazel (or plain vodka) to an 8 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 15-20 drops of your chosen essential oil. Try lavender for calm, lemon for freshness, or eucalyptus for an invigorating scent.
3. Fill the rest of the bottle with water.
4. Cap and shake well before each use — oil and water will naturally separate between uses.
5. Mist lightly into the air or onto soft furnishings from a distance of about 12 inches.

## Why It Works

Essential oils contain volatile aromatic compounds that replace stale or unpleasant odors with natural fragrance. The witch hazel (or vodka) acts as an emulsifier, helping the oil droplets disperse evenly throughout the water rather than floating on top. This creates a finer, more even mist when sprayed.

## Suggested Blends

- **Relaxing**: 10 drops lavender + 5 drops chamomile
- **Energizing**: 10 drops lemon + 5 drops peppermint
- **Clean & fresh**: 8 drops eucalyptus + 7 drops tea tree (not for homes with cats)
- **Seasonal**: 10 drops sweet orange + 5 drops cinnamon

## Tips

- Use a glass spray bottle — essential oils can break down plastic over time.
- Shake vigorously before every spray to re-mix the oils.
- This spray does not stain most fabrics, but test on an inconspicuous area first.
- Use within 1-2 weeks for the strongest scent, though the spray remains safe to use for much longer.
