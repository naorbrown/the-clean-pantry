## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of baking soda into a small open dish, jar, or decorative bowl.
2. Optionally, stir in 5-10 drops of essential oil for a light fragrance.
3. Place the dish in the room where odors are a problem — near trash cans, in bathrooms, closets, or on kitchen counters.
4. Stir the baking soda every week or so to expose fresh surface area.
5. Replace the entire dish every 30 days.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is amphoteric, meaning it can neutralize both acidic and basic odor molecules. Most household odors — from food, pets, and garbage — are either acidic or basic compounds floating in the air. When these molecules contact the surface of the baking soda, a chemical reaction neutralizes them rather than simply masking the smell with fragrance.

## Alternative

Activated charcoal works even more effectively as an odor absorber. Place a few pieces in a breathable cloth bag and set it in the room. Activated charcoal has a massive porous surface area that traps odor molecules through adsorption. Recharge it monthly by placing it in direct sunlight for a few hours.
## Tips

- For extra effectiveness, use a wide, shallow dish to maximize surface area.
- Place one in the refrigerator, one near the litter box, and one in any musty closet.
- The used baking soda still works as a cleaning abrasive — pour it down the drain with vinegar for a quick drain freshener.
