## Steps

1. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of dried lavender buds and 1/4 cup of dried rosemary. Break up any large rosemary pieces with your fingers.
2. Add 1/4 cup of baking soda and stir to distribute it evenly throughout the dried herbs.
3. Add 10-15 drops of lavender essential oil to the mixture and stir again. The oil intensifies the scent and helps it last longer than dried herbs alone.
4. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes so the baking soda absorbs the essential oil.
5. Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the mixture into each muslin bag or fabric square. If using fabric squares, gather the corners and tie with a ribbon or twine.
6. Place sachets on shelves between folded sheets, in pillowcase stacks, inside blanket storage bins, and in dresser drawers.
7. Gently squeeze each sachet every week or two to release more fragrance from the dried herbs.

## Why It Works

Dried lavender naturally releases linalool and linalyl acetate -- aromatic compounds that give lavender its characteristic scent. These compounds are mildly antimicrobial and help discourage moths and other fabric pests. Rosemary contains camphor and eucalyptol, which add a clean, sharp note and have additional insect-repellent properties. The baking soda absorbs ambient moisture and neutralizes musty odors that develop in enclosed spaces with limited airflow, while the essential oil provides a concentrated boost to the dried herbs' natural fragrance.

The combination addresses both freshness (adding pleasant scent) and staleness (absorbing moisture and neutralizing odors) at the same time.

## Alternative

For a no-sew option, use a clean sock. Fill the toe section with the herb mixture, tie off the opening with a rubber band, and fold the cuff over the rubber band for a clean look. Old cotton socks work perfectly and are breathable enough to release fragrance. This is a great way to use mismatched socks.
## Tips

- Refresh sachets every 4-6 weeks by adding 2-3 drops of essential oil to each one. The dried herbs will last 3-6 months before needing full replacement.
- Cedar chips make an excellent addition or substitution. Cedar repels moths and silverfish and provides a warm, woody scent. Add 2 tablespoons of cedar chips per sachet.
- For a seasonal variation, use dried orange peel and whole cloves with cinnamon essential oil during fall and winter.
- Place a sachet inside luggage and storage bins to keep them fresh between uses.
- Avoid placing sachets in direct contact with white linens -- the herbs and oils will not stain through muslin, but if a sachet tears open, loose herbs could leave marks. Double-bag if concerned.
- Dried herbs are available in bulk online or at natural food stores. You can also dry your own lavender by hanging fresh bundles upside down in a warm, dry place for 1-2 weeks.
