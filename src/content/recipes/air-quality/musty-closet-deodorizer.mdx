## Steps

1. Pour half a cup of baking soda into a small bowl and add 5 drops of essential oil. Stir with a fork until the oil is distributed evenly through the powder.
2. If using dried lavender buds, fold 1 tablespoon into the baking soda mixture.
3. Place the scented baking soda in the center of a muslin or cheesecloth square.
4. Gather the corners together and secure with twine or a rubber band to form a small sachet bundle.
5. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make a second sachet.
6. Place one sachet on a closet shelf and hang the other from a hanger hook or closet rod using a length of twine.
7. Squeeze the sachet gently once a week to reactivate the powder inside.
8. Replace every 4-6 weeks, or whenever the scent fades and the closet smell returns.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is amphoteric, meaning it can neutralize both acids and bases. Most musty closet odors come from mildew-producing volatile organic compounds that are mildly acidic. When these airborne molecules contact the baking soda, they undergo an acid-base reaction that converts them into odorless sodium salts. The breathable fabric allows air to circulate through the powder while keeping it contained. Cedarwood essential oil adds a pleasant woody scent and contains cedrol and thujopsene, compounds with mild antifungal properties that help discourage the mildew growth causing the mustiness in the first place.

## Tips

- If your closet is particularly damp, place a small dish of plain baking soda on the floor as well. Moisture absorption is a separate problem from odor, and more surface area helps.
- Cedarwood oil is a traditional moth deterrent. Using it in closets where you store wool or silk gives you a two-for-one benefit.
- Do not use scented baking soda sachets directly on leather goods, as prolonged contact with the powder can dry out leather.
- After removing the old sachets, sprinkle the used baking soda down your kitchen drain with hot water as a drain freshener.
