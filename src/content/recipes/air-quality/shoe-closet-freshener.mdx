## Steps

1. Combine the activated charcoal and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Stir gently to blend -- avoid creating dust by stirring slowly.
2. Add 10 drops of tea tree or peppermint essential oil to the mixture and stir to distribute.
3. If using dried rosemary, fold it into the mixture.
4. Divide the mixture evenly among the 4 muslin bags or clean old socks. Each bag should be about half full to allow air to circulate through the contents.
5. Tie or cinch the bags closed securely. If using socks, tie a knot at the open end.
6. Place one bag in each problem area: inside shoes, on closet shelves, or hanging from hooks on the closet rod.
7. Every 2 weeks, place the bags in direct sunlight for 2-3 hours to recharge the activated charcoal.
8. Replace the mixture every 2-3 months, or add fresh essential oil monthly to maintain the scent.

## Why It Works

Activated charcoal is one of the most effective odor absorbers available. The "activation" process (heating charcoal to extreme temperatures with steam) creates millions of microscopic pores in each granule, giving a single gram of activated charcoal a surface area of roughly 3,000 square meters. These pores physically trap odor molecules through adsorption -- the molecules cling to the charcoal surface rather than floating in the air. Baking soda complements the charcoal by chemically neutralizing acidic odor compounds like isovaleric acid, the primary component of foot odor. Tea tree oil provides antimicrobial action against the bacteria (Brevibacterium linens and Staphylococcus epidermidis) that cause foot odor when they break down sweat on skin and socks.

## Tips

- Activated charcoal can be "recharged" by placing the bags in direct sunlight. UV radiation and heat release the trapped odor molecules, freeing up the pore space for fresh absorption.
- Use granular or pellet charcoal, not powder. Powder will create black dust that escapes through the fabric.
- Handle charcoal carefully -- it stains fabric, countertops, and grout. Work over newspaper or a dark towel.
- For shoes specifically, stuff the pouches directly inside overnight for the strongest effect.
- These pouches also work well in gym bags, lockers, and car trunks.
