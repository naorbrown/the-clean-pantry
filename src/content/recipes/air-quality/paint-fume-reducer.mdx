## Steps

1. Open all windows and doors in the painted room to establish cross-ventilation. This is the most important step and should not be skipped.
2. Fill 2 shallow bowls with white vinegar (about 1 cup each) and place them on opposite sides of the room.
3. Fill 2 shallow bowls or plates with activated charcoal (about 1/2 cup each) and place them near the freshly painted walls.
4. Sprinkle 1 cup of baking soda into 1-2 additional shallow bowls and distribute them around the room.
5. Cut a lemon in half and place each half cut-side-up in the room. The exposed surface releases limonene, which helps with the perceived smell.
6. Leave all bowls in place for 24-48 hours. Replace the vinegar every 12 hours if the paint smell is strong.
7. After 48 hours, remove the bowls. Discard the charcoal and baking soda. The vinegar can be poured down the drain.
8. Continue ventilating the room for at least 3 more days after painting, even after the smell fades.

## Why It Works

Fresh paint releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs) -- primarily formaldehyde, toluene, and xylene -- as the paint cures. These compounds are what produce the characteristic paint smell. White vinegar absorbs VOCs through a combination of dissolution (the compounds are partially soluble in acetic acid) and chemical reaction. Activated charcoal traps VOC molecules through physical adsorption in its millions of microscopic pores. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic components of paint fumes. Together, these three materials address different fractions of the VOC mixture. The lemon halves release d-limonene, which has a strong citrus scent that masks the residual paint smell and is itself a mild solvent that can interact with airborne paint compounds. However, ventilation remains the primary means of reducing VOC exposure -- these bowls are a supplement, not a replacement.

## Tips

- Place bowls as close to the painted surfaces as possible without touching them. VOC concentration is highest near the wet paint surface.
- Low-VOC and zero-VOC paints produce far less odor and off-gassing. If you have not yet purchased paint, choosing these formulas reduces the problem at the source.
- Do not seal the room thinking the bowls will do all the work. Air exchange is the single most effective way to reduce paint fumes.
- This method also works for new furniture, new carpet, and other sources of off-gassing.
- If anyone in the household has asthma or chemical sensitivities, they should avoid the room entirely until ventilation is complete, regardless of whether bowls are placed.
