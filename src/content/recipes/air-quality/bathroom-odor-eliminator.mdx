## Steps

1. Add 1 teaspoon of rubbing alcohol to a 2 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 30 drops of essential oil. A combination of 15 drops peppermint and 15 drops eucalyptus creates a strong, fresh scent.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin.
4. Fill the remainder of the bottle with water.
5. Cap and shake well to combine.
6. To use, spray 3-5 spritzes directly onto the toilet water surface before use. The oils form a thin film that traps odors beneath the water line.
7. Shake the bottle before each use, as the oils will separate naturally.

## Why It Works

This spray works on a simple physical principle: essential oils are hydrophobic and less dense than water, so they float on the surface and form a thin film. When sprayed onto the toilet water, the oils create a molecular barrier that traps odor-causing gases (hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptans, and volatile fatty acids) beneath the water surface. The vegetable glycerin acts as a surfactant that helps the oil film spread evenly across the water rather than pooling in one spot. The rubbing alcohol serves as an emulsifier in the bottle, keeping the oil partially dispersed in the water so the spray delivers an even mixture. Peppermint oil contains menthol, which triggers cold receptors in the nose, creating the sensation of freshness that further masks any escaping odor.

## Tips

- Keep the bottle next to the toilet for easy access. The small 2 oz size is also travel-friendly.
- Peppermint and eucalyptus are the most effective at masking bathroom odors, but lemon and lavender also work well.
- If you find the scent too strong, reduce the essential oil to 20 drops.
- The spray leaves a slight oily residue on the water surface. This is normal and flushes away completely.
- Replace the mixture every 2-3 months, as the essential oils lose potency over time.
