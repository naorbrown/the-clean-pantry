## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda slowly. The mixture will fizz briefly -- wait for the fizzing to stop before continuing.
3. Add 1 cup of water to fill the bottle.
4. Add 15 drops of eucalyptus or lemon essential oil.
5. Cap the bottle and shake gently to combine.
6. Open windows in the affected room to allow cross-ventilation.
7. Mist the spray into the air, onto curtains, upholstery, and any soft surfaces that have absorbed smoke. Spray from about 12 inches away using a fine mist setting.
8. Allow surfaces to air dry completely. The vinegar smell will dissipate within 20-30 minutes, taking smoke odor with it.

## Why It Works

Smoke odor clings because the tiny particulate matter in smoke (soot, tar, and volatile organic compounds) bonds to fabric fibers and porous surfaces. Acetic acid in vinegar breaks down these organic compounds through a chemical reaction rather than simply masking them. The baking soda provides additional alkaline neutralization for the acidic components of smoke residue. Eucalyptus oil contains 1,8-cineole, a compound with antimicrobial properties that also helps cut through the greasy film that smoke deposits on surfaces. The combination of chemical neutralization and solvent action makes this more effective than fragrance-only air fresheners, which merely layer a new scent over the smoke.

## Tips

- For heavy smoke saturation (like after a kitchen fire), set out open bowls of undiluted white vinegar around the room overnight. The larger surface area absorbs more smoke compounds from the air.
- Do not use this spray on marble, granite, or other natural stone. The acetic acid etches polished stone surfaces.
- Wash any machine-washable fabrics (curtains, cushion covers, throw blankets) separately with a cup of vinegar added to the rinse cycle.
- This spray also works on campfire smell in jackets and outdoor gear. Hang the garment outdoors and mist both sides.
