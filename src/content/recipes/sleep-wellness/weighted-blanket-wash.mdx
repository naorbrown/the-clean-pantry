## Steps

1. Check the care label on your weighted blanket. If it specifies machine wash, follow those instructions instead. This method is for blankets that require or benefit from hand washing.
2. Fill a clean bathtub halfway with cold water.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of castile soap and swirl with your hand to dissolve.
4. Submerge the weighted blanket fully, pressing it down so the water saturates the fabric.
5. Gently agitate the blanket by lifting and pressing sections, working your way across the entire blanket. Do not wring or twist.
6. Let it soak for 15-20 minutes.
7. Drain the soapy water completely.
8. Refill the tub with clean cold water. Press and agitate the blanket gently to rinse out the soap. Drain and repeat the rinse until the water runs clear with no suds.
9. Press as much water out as possible by rolling sections of the blanket and pressing down. Do not wring.
10. Lay the blanket flat to dry on a clean, dry surface -- a drying rack, clean shower rod, or several towels spread on the floor. Flip it halfway through drying.

## Why It Works

Weighted blankets contain glass beads, plastic pellets, or steel shot distributed in small sewn pockets. Machine washing can shift the fill material, stress the seams, and cause uneven weight distribution. Hot water can also melt or deform plastic pellets. Castile soap is a gentle surfactant that dissolves body oils and sweat without leaving residue that can make the fabric feel stiff or irritate skin. Cold water preserves both the fabric and the fill material while still effectively cleaning with the help of the soap.

## Tips

- Wash your weighted blanket every 2-3 months, or use a removable duvet cover that you wash more frequently.
- If your blanket is under 15 pounds and the care label allows, you may be able to machine wash on a gentle/delicate cycle with cold water. Use a front-loading machine if possible -- top-loaders with agitators can damage the blanket.
- Never put a weighted blanket in the dryer unless the manufacturer explicitly says it is safe. The weight combined with heat can damage the dryer drum and the blanket.
- Spot-clean stains as soon as they happen with a damp cloth and a drop of castile soap to extend time between full washes.
- Drying may take 24-48 hours depending on blanket weight and humidity. A fan or open windows speed up the process.
