## Steps

1. Unplug the white noise machine, alarm clock, or other bedside electronics.
2. Mix 1/2 cup of distilled water with 1/2 cup of white vinegar in a small bowl or spray bottle.
3. Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with the solution -- wring it out well so the cloth is damp, not wet.
4. Wipe down all exterior surfaces of the device, including the speaker grilles, buttons, and base.
5. For speaker grilles and vents, use a dry soft-bristled brush (a clean paintbrush or makeup brush works well) to dislodge dust first, then follow with the damp cloth.
6. Use a dry microfiber cloth to remove any remaining moisture.
7. Let the device air dry completely before plugging it back in.

## Why It Works

Bedside electronics collect dust, skin cells, and oils from your hands, all of which accumulate over time and can harbor dust mites and bacteria. The vinegar solution provides mild disinfection while cutting through finger oils. Using distilled water instead of tap water prevents mineral spots from forming on glossy surfaces. The key to safely cleaning electronics is controlling the amount of moisture -- a barely damp microfiber cloth cleans effectively without allowing liquid to enter the device through openings.

## Tips

- Clean bedside electronics every 1-2 weeks. Dust accumulates faster than you think on devices that sit in one place.
- Never use paper towels on screens or glossy surfaces -- they can leave micro-scratches. Microfiber is the only cloth you should use.
- For stubborn grime in crevices, dip a cotton swab in the vinegar solution and carefully clean around buttons and seams.
- If the device has a fabric cover (common on some sound machines), check if it is removable and machine washable. Many are.
