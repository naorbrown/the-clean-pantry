## Steps

1. Add 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel to a clean 8 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of cedarwood essential oil and 10 drops of lavender essential oil.
3. Swirl gently to combine the oils with the witch hazel.
4. Fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water.
5. Cap tightly and shake well.
6. About 20-30 minutes before bed, spray 4-5 mists into the center of the room, aiming upward so the mist drifts and disperses naturally. Do not spray directly onto bedding or faces.

## Why It Works

Cedarwood oil contains cedrol, a sesquiterpene alcohol that has been studied for its sedative effects. Research published in the Japanese Journal of Pharmacology found that cedrol inhalation increased parasympathetic nervous system activity, which is the body's rest-and-digest mode. Combined with lavender's linalool, which lowers heart rate and blood pressure, this blend creates a genuinely calming aromatic environment. The witch hazel emulsifies the oils into the water so you get a fine, even mist rather than oily droplets.

## Tips

- Spray into the air, not directly onto furniture or bedding. This allows the mist to settle gradually and scent the room evenly.
- If you prefer a lighter scent, reduce to 6-8 drops of each oil.
- For warmer months, try swapping cedarwood for chamomile essential oil (5 drops), which has a lighter, less woodsy scent.
- Store out of direct sunlight to preserve the essential oils.
- Use within 2-3 weeks for the best aromatic strength.
