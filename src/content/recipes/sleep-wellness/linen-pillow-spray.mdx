## Steps

1. Pour 1 oz of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of lavender essential oil and 5 drops of cedarwood essential oil.
3. Swirl gently to combine the witch hazel and oils.
4. Fill the remainder of the bottle with distilled water, leaving a small gap at the top.
5. Cap and shake well.
6. Spray 2-3 light mists onto your pillow and sheets about 15-20 minutes before bed. Shake before each use.

## Why It Works

Lavender (lavandula angustifolia) contains linalool and linalyl acetate, two compounds that have been shown in clinical studies to reduce heart rate and blood pressure, promoting a calmer state before sleep. Witch hazel acts as a natural emulsifier that helps the essential oil droplets disperse evenly in water, creating a fine mist rather than oily spots on your fabric. The scent dissipates to a subtle level by the time you lay down, providing gentle aromatherapy without being overwhelming.

## Tips

- Use distilled water to prevent mineral deposits from building up on fabric over time.
- Shake vigorously before every use -- oil and water separate naturally between uses.
- Replace every 3-4 weeks. Essential oils oxidize and lose their aromatic potency over time.
- A dark glass bottle protects the essential oils from UV degradation. Amber or cobalt blue works well.
- You can also mist this on curtains, a stuffed animal for a child's room, or a cloth placed near your bed.
