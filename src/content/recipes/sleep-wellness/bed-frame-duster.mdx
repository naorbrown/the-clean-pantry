## Steps

1. Mix 1 cup of water with 1 cup of white vinegar in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Pull the bed away from the wall to access the headboard back and bed frame sides.
3. Use a dry microfiber cloth or duster to sweep loose dust off the bed frame, headboard, slats, and any under-bed area you can reach. Work from top to bottom.
4. Lightly spray the vinegar solution onto a clean microfiber cloth (not directly onto the furniture).
5. Wipe all surfaces of the bed frame and headboard -- top rails, legs, slats, and support bars.
6. For under-bed areas, attach a damp microfiber cloth to a flat mop or wrap it around a broom to reach the full area.
7. Wipe dry with a clean cloth to prevent water spots on wood finishes.

## Why It Works

The area under and around your bed is one of the dustiest zones in your home. Dust accumulates on horizontal surfaces and bed frames because the bedroom generates a constant supply of skin cells, fabric fibers, and hair. This dust feeds dust mites, which produce allergen-containing fecal particles that become airborne when disturbed. The vinegar solution cuts through the sticky film of oils and moisture that causes dust to adhere to surfaces, making it easier to remove and slower to re-accumulate. Regular cleaning of these often-forgotten surfaces measurably reduces airborne allergens in the bedroom.

## Tips

- Clean your bed frame and under-bed area at least every 2 weeks. Monthly is the absolute minimum for allergy sufferers.
- If you have a fabric headboard, vacuum it with an upholstery attachment instead of using this spray. The spray is for wood, metal, and painted surfaces.
- Consider under-bed storage with sealed containers or bags rather than open boxes, which collect dust.
- Bed risers can lift the bed higher for easier cleaning access underneath.
- After spraying down the area, leave the bed pulled out from the wall for 10 minutes to let everything dry before pushing it back.
