## Steps

1. Unplug the diffuser and empty any remaining water and oil from the reservoir.
2. Fill the reservoir halfway with clean water.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar.
4. Plug the diffuser back in and run it for 10-15 minutes. This allows the vinegar solution to work through the internal ultrasonic mechanism.
5. Unplug the diffuser and drain all the liquid.
6. Dip a cotton swab in undiluted white vinegar and carefully clean the ultrasonic disc (the small ceramic plate at the bottom of the reservoir). Gently wipe away any visible oil residue or mineral buildup.
7. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the interior walls of the reservoir.
8. Rinse the reservoir with clean water 2-3 times.
9. Wipe dry with a soft cloth and leave the lid off to air dry completely before next use.

## Why It Works

Essential oils leave behind a thin residue on the ultrasonic disc and reservoir walls with each use. Over time, this residue builds up and reduces the diffuser's output, mixes old oil scents with new ones, and creates an environment where mold can grow in the stagnant moisture. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves both the oil residue and any mineral deposits from tap water. Running the vinegar solution through the active diffuser ensures it reaches internal components that you cannot access by hand.

## Tips

- Clean your diffuser every 3-5 uses, or at least once per week if you use it nightly. Skipping cleaning is the number one reason diffusers stop misting effectively.
- Never use dish soap or other detergents inside a diffuser. Soap residue is very difficult to rinse completely and will be aerosolized into your room on the next use.
- If the ultrasonic disc looks cloudy or the diffuser's mist output has weakened, the disc likely has heavy mineral buildup. Soak a cotton ball in undiluted vinegar and place it directly on the disc for 15 minutes before scrubbing.
- Always empty your diffuser after each use. Standing water grows bacteria and mold within 24-48 hours.
- Use distilled water in your diffuser to minimize mineral buildup.
