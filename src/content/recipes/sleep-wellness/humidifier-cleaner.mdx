## Steps

1. Unplug the humidifier and disassemble it completely -- remove the tank, tray, filter (if applicable), and any removable parts.
2. Empty all remaining water from the tank and base.
3. Mix 2 cups of white vinegar with 2 cups of water.
4. Pour the vinegar solution into the water tank and swirl it around so it contacts all interior surfaces. Pour some into the base as well, covering any areas with visible mineral buildup.
5. Let the solution sit for 30-60 minutes. For heavy scale buildup, use undiluted vinegar and extend the soak to 2 hours.
6. Use a soft brush (an old toothbrush works well) to scrub away any loosened mineral deposits, paying special attention to the ultrasonic disc or heating element.
7. Drain the vinegar solution from all parts.
8. Rinse every component thoroughly with clean water at least 2-3 times until no vinegar smell remains.
9. Wipe all surfaces dry with a clean cloth and let the parts air dry completely before reassembling.

## Why It Works

White vinegar (5% acetic acid) dissolves calcium carbonate and other mineral deposits that accumulate from tap water evaporation. These mineral deposits create a rough, porous surface that harbors mold and bacteria -- the same organisms that then get aerosolized into your bedroom air every time the humidifier runs. The acidity of vinegar also kills most common molds and many bacteria on contact. Regular descaling keeps the humidifier running efficiently and prevents it from becoming a source of airborne contaminants in your sleep environment.

## Tips

- Clean your humidifier at least once per week during active use. Mold can begin growing within 48 hours in standing water.
- Always use the freshest water possible in your humidifier. Empty and refill the tank daily rather than topping off old water.
- If your humidifier has a filter, check the manufacturer's recommendations -- some filters should be replaced rather than cleaned.
- Using distilled water in your humidifier dramatically reduces mineral buildup and the white dust that ultrasonic humidifiers can produce.
- For stubborn pink slime (Serratia marcescens bacteria), scrub the affected area with undiluted vinegar and a brush before soaking.
