## Steps

1. Fill a large basin, bathtub, or clean sink with 1 gallon of warm water (not hot -- hot water can damage the blackout coating).
2. Add 1 tablespoon of unscented castile soap and swirl gently to dissolve.
3. Remove the curtains from their rod and submerge them in the soapy water.
4. Gently agitate the curtains by hand for 2-3 minutes, pressing and releasing the fabric rather than wringing or scrubbing.
5. Let the curtains soak for 10-15 minutes.
6. Drain the soapy water and refill with clean cool water. Gently press the curtains to rinse out the soap. Repeat the rinse if you still feel soap residue.
7. Hang the curtains back on the rod while still damp -- the weight of the water helps smooth out wrinkles as they dry. Place a towel on the floor beneath to catch drips.

## Why It Works

Blackout curtains use a foam or polymer coating on the back of the fabric to block light. Machine washing, hot water, and harsh detergents break down this coating over time, causing it to crack, peel, or flake off. Castile soap is a mild surfactant derived from plant oils that effectively lifts dust, skin oils, and cooking residue without the alkalinity or chemical additives that degrade these coatings. Hand washing with gentle agitation preserves both the blackout layer and the fabric itself.

## Tips

- Never machine wash or machine dry blackout curtains unless the care label explicitly says it is safe. The tumbling action accelerates coating breakdown.
- Vacuum your curtains monthly with an upholstery brush attachment to reduce how often you need to wash them.
- If the curtains smell musty between washes, mist the fabric side (not the coated side) lightly with a vinegar-water spray and let them air dry.
- Check the water temperature with your wrist -- it should feel comfortably warm, not hot. Aim for around 85-95 degrees Fahrenheit.
