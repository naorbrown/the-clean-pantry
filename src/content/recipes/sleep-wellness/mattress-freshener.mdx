## Steps

1. Add 1 cup of baking soda to a medium mixing bowl.
2. Add 10 drops of lavender essential oil to the baking soda.
3. Use a fork to mix and break up any clumps until the oil is evenly distributed throughout the powder.
4. Strip your bed completely -- remove all sheets, pillows, and mattress protectors.
5. Sprinkle the powder evenly across the entire mattress surface using a fine-mesh sieve or shaker jar for even distribution.
6. Let the powder sit for at least 30 minutes. For best results, leave it for 1-2 hours.
7. Vacuum the entire mattress thoroughly using the upholstery attachment, making slow overlapping passes.
8. Flip or rotate the mattress if due, then remake the bed.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a powerful odor neutralizer because it is amphoteric -- it reacts with both acidic and alkaline odor molecules, converting them into neutral sodium salts that have no smell. It also absorbs moisture, which is significant because the average person releases about half a pint of sweat into their mattress every night. The lavender oil provides a pleasant scent, but the real deodorizing work is done by the baking soda's chemical neutralization of odor compounds.

## Tips

- Do this on a day when you are washing your sheets so the mattress has time to sit bare.
- Open a window or run a fan while the powder sits to help air circulate around the mattress.
- For stubborn odors (pet accidents, spills), double the baking soda and let it sit for a full 2 hours.
- Repeat monthly for freshest results, or at minimum every time you rotate your mattress.
- Store premixed powder in a sealed jar for up to 2 months. The lavender scent fades over time but the deodorizing power remains.
