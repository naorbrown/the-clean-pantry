## Steps

1. Fill a small bowl or clean sink with 2 cups of cool water.
2. Add 1/2 teaspoon of unscented castile soap and stir gently to dissolve.
3. Submerge the sleep mask in the soapy water.
4. Gently press and release the mask several times, working the soapy water through the fabric. Do not rub, twist, or wring -- especially with silk masks.
5. Let the mask soak for 5-10 minutes.
6. Drain the soapy water and rinse the mask under cool running water, gently pressing to release soap until the water runs clear.
7. Press the mask between two clean, dry towels to absorb excess water. Do not wring.
8. Lay flat on a clean towel or hang to air dry. Keep away from direct sunlight, which can fade and weaken silk fibers.

## Why It Works

Sleep masks press directly against the delicate skin around your eyes for 7-9 hours every night, accumulating facial oils, sweat, dead skin cells, and any skincare products you apply before bed. These residues feed bacteria and can contribute to breakouts, eye irritation, and styes. Castile soap is gentle enough for silk and satin because it is free of sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and harsh surfactants that strip natural fibers. Cool water prevents silk protein fibers from contracting and losing their smooth texture, which is what happens when silk is washed in hot water.

## Tips

- Wash your sleep mask at least once per week, more often if you use heavy nighttime skincare products.
- Never machine wash silk sleep masks -- the agitation damages the fibers and elastic. Satin polyester masks are more durable but still benefit from hand washing.
- If your mask has a removable insert or padding, take it out and wash it separately.
- To maintain silk's softness, you can add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the final rinse water. The vinegar restores silk's natural pH and sheen.
- Keep a second sleep mask in rotation so you always have a clean one while the other dries.
