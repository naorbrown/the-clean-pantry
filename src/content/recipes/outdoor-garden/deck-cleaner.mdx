## Steps

1. Sweep the deck thoroughly to remove loose debris, leaves, and dirt.
2. In a bucket, dissolve 1/2 cup of sodium percarbonate in 1 gallon of warm water. Stir until the powder is fully dissolved. Warm water (not hot) activates the oxygen bleach most effectively.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap and stir gently.
4. Wet down any adjacent plants or garden beds with plain water. This dilutes any cleaner runoff and protects vegetation.
5. Pour or brush the solution onto the deck in manageable sections, working about 4-6 square feet at a time.
6. Let the solution sit for 10-15 minutes. Do not let it dry on the surface -- reapply if it starts drying in hot weather.
7. Scrub each section with a stiff deck brush, working along the grain of the wood.
8. Rinse thoroughly with a garden hose. A strong nozzle setting helps, but avoid using a pressure washer on high settings, which can damage wood fibers.
9. For an optional brightening step, mix 1 cup of white vinegar into 1 gallon of water and apply to the rinsed deck. This neutralizes any alkaline residue and restores the wood's natural color. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then rinse again.
10. Allow the deck to dry for 24-48 hours before applying any sealant or stain.

## Why It Works

Sodium percarbonate breaks down into hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate (washing soda) when dissolved in water. The hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that kills mildew, mold, and algae spores on contact by destroying their cell walls. The sodium carbonate raises the solution's pH, which helps dissolve grease, tannin stains, and organic grime. Castile soap reduces surface tension, allowing the cleaning solution to penetrate into the wood grain rather than beading up on the surface. The vinegar rinse step is a mild acid that neutralizes the alkaline cleaning residue, preventing wood fibers from swelling and greying over time.

## Alternative

For a lighter monthly maintenance clean, mix 1/4 cup of castile soap into a gallon of warm water and mop the deck with a deck brush. This handles surface dirt, pollen, and light grime without the oxygen bleach. Save the full sodium percarbonate treatment for the annual deep clean.
## Tips

- The best time to clean a deck is on an overcast day between 50-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Direct sun causes the solution to dry too quickly, reducing its effectiveness.
- For mold-stained boards, increase the sodium percarbonate to 3/4 cup per gallon and extend the dwell time to 20 minutes.
- Clean your deck at least once a year, ideally in spring before the outdoor season begins.
- Sodium percarbonate is color-safe and will not bleach or strip wood stain the way chlorine bleach does.
- Rinse plants with plain water again after you finish cleaning as an extra precaution.
