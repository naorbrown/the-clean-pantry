## Steps

1. Pour 3 tablespoons of witch hazel into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle. Glass is preferred because essential oils can degrade plastic over time.
2. Add 3 tablespoons of distilled water.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. This helps the essential oils emulsify with the water-based ingredients.
4. Add 20 drops of lemon eucalyptus essential oil, 10 drops of lavender essential oil, and 10 drops of citronella essential oil.
5. Cap the bottle and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds to combine.
6. Shake before every use, as the oils will naturally separate from the water.
7. Spray onto exposed skin and clothing before going outdoors. Avoid the face -- spray onto your hands first and then apply to your face and neck.

## Why It Works

Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) is the only plant-based insect repellent ingredient registered with the EPA and recommended by the CDC as effective against mosquitoes. Its active compound, para-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD), provides protection comparable to low concentrations of DEET in peer-reviewed studies. Citronella masks the human scent cues (carbon dioxide and lactic acid) that mosquitoes use to locate hosts. Lavender oil contains linalool, a compound shown to repel mosquitoes, gnats, and flies. Witch hazel serves as the carrier solvent and has mild astringent properties that help the formula adhere to skin. Vegetable glycerin acts as an emulsifier and adds a slight moisturizing effect.

## Alternative

For a repellent-infused body balm that lasts longer on skin, melt 2 tablespoons of coconut oil with 1 tablespoon of beeswax in a double boiler. Remove from heat and stir in 15 drops of lemon eucalyptus oil and 10 drops of lavender oil. Pour into a small tin and let it solidify. Apply to pulse points (wrists, ankles, behind ears) before heading outdoors.
## Tips

- Store in a cool, dark place. Essential oils lose potency when exposed to heat and light. The spray keeps for 2-3 months.
- For tick-prone areas, add 10 drops of geranium essential oil, which has shown repellent activity against ticks in research studies.
- This spray works best when applied to both skin and clothing. Spray clothing from about 6 inches away.
- Do not rely on this spray in areas with high risk of mosquito-borne disease (malaria, dengue, Zika). In those situations, use an EPA-registered repellent with proven efficacy.
- A patch test on your inner wrist 24 hours before full application is recommended, especially for those with sensitive skin.
