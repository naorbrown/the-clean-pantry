## Steps

1. Combine the isopropyl alcohol and white vinegar in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the water and castile soap. Swirl gently to mix without creating excess foam.
3. Add the tea tree essential oil drops and cap the bottle tightly.
4. Shake the bottle gently for 10 seconds to combine all ingredients.
5. To use, spray garden tools thoroughly after each use, coating all cutting surfaces and handles.
6. Let the spray sit on the tool surface for 60 seconds to allow full disinfection.
7. Wipe dry with a clean cloth or allow to air dry. The alcohol evaporates quickly.

## Why It Works

Isopropyl alcohol is a broad-spectrum disinfectant that kills bacteria, fungi, and viruses on contact by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their cell membranes. At 70% concentration, it is more effective than higher concentrations because the water content slows evaporation, giving the alcohol more contact time with pathogens. White vinegar adds acetic acid, which is particularly effective against fungal spores like those that cause powdery mildew, blight, and rust -- common garden diseases transmitted between plants on dirty tools. Tea tree oil contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound with proven antifungal and antibacterial properties that provides residual protection after the alcohol evaporates. The small amount of castile soap acts as a surfactant, ensuring the spray coats the tool surface evenly rather than beading up on oily or dirty metal.

## Tips

- Always sanitize pruners between plants, especially when pruning diseased branches. This prevents cross-contamination.
- Make a habit of spraying tools before putting them away at the end of each gardening session.
- For heavily soiled tools, scrub off dirt with a wire brush first, then spray the sanitizer.
- Store the spray bottle in your garden shed or tool caddy for easy access.
- This spray also works well for cleaning pots and seed trays between plantings.
