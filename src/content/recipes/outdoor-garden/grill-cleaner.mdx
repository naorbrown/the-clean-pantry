## Steps

1. Ensure the grill is completely cool. Remove the grates and place them on a flat surface covered with newspaper or an old towel.
2. In a bowl, mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of coarse salt.
3. Slowly add the white vinegar to the dry mixture, stirring as it fizzes. You want a thick, spreadable paste -- add the vinegar gradually to control the consistency.
4. Apply the paste generously to the grill grates using a brush or your gloved hands, covering all surfaces including the undersides and between the bars.
5. Let the paste sit for 20-30 minutes. For heavily soiled grates with thick carbon buildup, leave it for a full hour.
6. Scrub the grates with a stiff-bristled brush or crumpled ball of aluminum foil. The coarse salt provides additional abrasive action as you scrub.
7. Rinse the grates thoroughly with a garden hose or in a large sink.
8. Dry the grates completely with a clean towel.
9. Apply a thin coat of vegetable oil to the clean grates using a paper towel. This re-seasons the metal surface and prevents rust between uses.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild alkaline abrasive (pH around 8.3) that reacts with the acidic carbonized food residue and grease on grill grates. When combined with vinegar, the initial fizzing reaction helps lift stuck-on debris from the metal surface. Coarse salt adds mechanical abrasion without scratching stainless steel or cast iron grates. The 20-30 minute dwell time allows the alkaline paste to soften and break the bond between baked-on carbon deposits and the metal surface, making scrubbing far more effective than dry brushing alone. The oil coating afterward fills microscopic pores in the metal, creating a barrier against moisture and oxidation.

## Alternative

For a soak method, place the grates in a large garbage bag or plastic bin. Pour 2 cups of white vinegar and 1 cup of baking soda over them, then add enough hot water to submerge. Seal and let them soak overnight. The extended contact time does most of the work -- you will need only light scrubbing the next morning.
## Tips

- For cast iron grates, the oil seasoning step is critical. Cast iron rusts quickly when left bare after cleaning.
- Clean your grill after every 3-5 uses to prevent extreme buildup that requires harsh chemicals.
- An onion cut in half and rubbed across hot grates (using long tongs) works as a quick mid-cookout cleaning method. The onion's moisture creates steam that loosens residue, and the acids help break down grease.
- Avoid commercial oven cleaners on grill grates. They contain sodium hydroxide (lye), which can leave toxic residue that transfers to food.
- Store grates in a dry location or cover your grill to prevent rust between cleanings.
