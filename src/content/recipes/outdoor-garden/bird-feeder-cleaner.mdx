## Steps

1. Disassemble the bird feeder completely, removing all perches, trays, and ports if possible.
2. Shake out old seed, hulls, and debris. Use a stiff brush to dislodge any caked-on material.
3. In a large bucket, combine the hot water, white vinegar, and baking soda. Let the fizzing subside.
4. Submerge all feeder parts in the solution and soak for 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Remove each piece and scrub with a bottle brush or old toothbrush dipped in coarse salt to remove stubborn buildup from feeding ports and crevices.
6. Prepare a rinse by adding the hydrogen peroxide to a bowl of clean water. Dip each scrubbed part in this rinse for a final sanitizing pass.
7. Rinse all parts thoroughly under running water for at least 30 seconds each, ensuring no cleaning residue remains.
8. Allow all pieces to air dry completely in direct sunlight before reassembling and refilling with fresh seed.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves the mold and mildew that thrive in the damp, seed-rich environment inside feeders. Baking soda adds alkaline buffering that helps break down dried bird droppings, which are slightly acidic. The coarse salt serves as a non-toxic mechanical abrasive that scours feeding ports and textured surfaces where biofilm accumulates. Hydrogen peroxide in the final rinse acts as an oxidizing disinfectant that kills bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli, which can spread disease between birds at feeding stations. Critically, all of these ingredients break down into harmless byproducts -- water, oxygen, and simple salts -- making the solution safe for wildlife once rinsed.

## Tips

- Clean feeders every two weeks during warm months and monthly during winter. Warm, humid weather accelerates mold growth.
- If you notice sick or lethargic birds at your feeder, clean immediately and leave the feeder empty for a week.
- Wooden feeders absorb moisture and cleaning solution. Extend the drying time to 24 hours for wood.
- A dedicated feeder-cleaning bottle brush makes the job much faster. Keep one near your outdoor hose.
- Hummingbird feeders should be cleaned every 3 to 5 days in summer using just hot water and a brush -- skip the vinegar soak.
