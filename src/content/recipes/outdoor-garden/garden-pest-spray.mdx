## Steps

1. Crush or finely mince 6 garlic cloves and place them in a jar or container with a lid.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper to the garlic.
3. Pour 4 cups of warm water over the garlic and cayenne mixture.
4. Stir well, cover, and let the mixture steep overnight (at least 8 hours). This allows the active compounds to fully infuse into the water.
5. Strain the mixture through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer into a clean 32 oz spray bottle. Discard the solids.
6. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap to the strained liquid and swirl gently to combine. Do not shake vigorously -- you want minimal foam.
7. To apply, spray both the tops and undersides of leaves where pests tend to feed and lay eggs.
8. Reapply after rain or every 3-5 days during active pest season.

## Why It Works

Garlic contains allicin and other sulfur compounds that are repulsive to a broad range of soft-bodied insects including aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. The sulfur compounds interfere with the insects' sensory receptors, making the treated plants undetectable or unpalatable. Capsaicin from cayenne pepper is an irritant to insects on contact -- it disrupts their feeding behavior and deters them from returning. The castile soap serves as a surfactant that helps the spray adhere to leaf surfaces instead of rolling off. It also has a secondary benefit: the fatty acids in soap can suffocate soft-bodied insects like aphids by blocking their spiracles (breathing pores).

## Tips

- Focus your spraying on the undersides of leaves. Most pest insects feed and lay eggs there, and this is where the spray is most needed.
- Test the spray on a few leaves before treating an entire plant. Some sensitive plants like young seedlings may react to the capsaicin.
- Make a fresh batch each week. The garlic compounds lose potency over time, especially in warm conditions.
- This spray is a deterrent, not a pesticide. It works best as a preventive measure applied before pest populations build up.
- Do not spray on flowers or flowering parts of vegetable plants. The soap can deter pollinators, which reduces your harvest.
- Store unused spray in the refrigerator for up to one week.

## Alternative

For a targeted aphid treatment, skip the overnight steeping. Dissolve 2 tablespoons of castile soap in 1 quart of water and spray directly on aphid clusters. The soap suffocates them on contact. Rinse the plants with plain water a few hours later to remove the soap residue and dead aphids. This quick method works well for small, localized infestations.
