## Steps

1. Measure the baking soda into a large mixing bowl.
2. Add the diatomaceous earth and stir to combine evenly.
3. Crush the dried herbs between your fingers as you add them to the bowl, releasing their essential oils.
4. Add the ground cinnamon and activated charcoal powder if using. Stir until the mixture is uniform in color and texture.
5. Transfer the powder to an airtight jar or container with a lid.
6. To use, sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons over the top of your compost bin after each addition of food scraps. Focus on kitchen waste like fruit peels, coffee grounds, and vegetable trimmings.
7. Store the remaining powder in a cool, dry place. It keeps for 6 months or longer.

## Why It Works

Compost odor is primarily caused by anaerobic decomposition, where bacteria break down organic matter without oxygen and produce hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and volatile fatty acids. Baking soda neutralizes these acidic compounds directly, raising the pH of the compost surface layer and interrupting the chemical reactions that produce foul smells. Diatomaceous earth is a highly porous mineral that absorbs moisture and odor molecules -- a single tablespoon has a surface area equivalent to a football field at the microscopic level. This moisture regulation also helps prevent the waterlogged anaerobic conditions that cause odor in the first place. Cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, a natural antimicrobial that suppresses mold growth on the compost surface. Activated charcoal adsorbs volatile organic compounds through its enormous internal surface area, trapping odor molecules in its microscopic pores.

## Tips

- The most common cause of smelly compost is too much green material (nitrogen) and not enough brown material (carbon). Add shredded cardboard or dry leaves along with the deodorizer.
- Sprinkle extra powder after adding meat-adjacent scraps like oily salad greens or cooked grains, which decompose with more odor.
- Turn your compost regularly to introduce oxygen. Aerobic decomposition produces far less odor than anaerobic.
- Keep the powder container near your kitchen compost caddy so it becomes part of your routine.
- This powder is safe for worm bins (vermicomposting) in small amounts, but avoid overusing baking soda, which can raise pH above what worms prefer.
