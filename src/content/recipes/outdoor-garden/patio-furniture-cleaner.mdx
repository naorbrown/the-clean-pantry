## Steps

1. Dissolve the baking soda in the warm water in a mixing bowl, stirring until no granules remain.
2. Add the white vinegar slowly. The mixture will fizz briefly as the vinegar reacts with the baking soda.
3. Stir in the castile soap gently to avoid creating too many suds.
4. Add the lemon essential oil if desired and stir to combine.
5. Pour the solution into a 32 oz spray bottle using a funnel.
6. Spray the furniture surface liberally, covering all dirty areas. Let the solution sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
7. Scrub with a soft-bristle brush or microfiber cloth, working in sections.
8. Rinse thoroughly with a garden hose and allow to air dry in the sun.

## Why It Works

White vinegar is a mild acid with a pH around 2.5 that dissolves mineral deposits, pollen buildup, and water stains commonly found on outdoor furniture. Castile soap acts as a surfactant, reducing the surface tension of water so it can penetrate and lift oily grime like sunscreen residue and food splatter. Baking soda provides gentle mechanical abrasion when scrubbing without scratching plastic, resin, or painted metal surfaces. The small amount used here also reacts with vinegar to produce sodium acetate, which helps dissolve sticky organic residues. Lemon oil contains d-limonene, a natural solvent that cuts through grease and leaves a fresh scent that dissipates quickly outdoors.

## Tips

- For white resin furniture that has yellowed, increase the baking soda to 1 tablespoon and make a paste. Apply, let sit for 15 minutes, then scrub and rinse.
- Clean outdoor furniture at least once a month during the season to prevent buildup that becomes harder to remove.
- Wipe down cushion-contact areas after cleaning to remove any soap residue before replacing cushions.
- Avoid using this on natural wicker -- the vinegar can break down the fibers over time.
- For wrought iron furniture, dry completely after cleaning to prevent flash rust.
