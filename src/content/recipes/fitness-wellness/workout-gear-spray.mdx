## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of vodka into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of tea tree, 8 drops of lemon, and 5 drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Swirl gently.
3. Add 1/4 cup of distilled water. Secure the spray nozzle and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds.
4. Turn garments inside out and spray a light, even mist over the fabric. Do not saturate.
5. Hang to air dry. The alcohol-water base evaporates within 15-20 minutes.
6. For shoes, spray 3-4 mists inside each shoe and leave in a ventilated area overnight.

## Why It Works

Ethanol evaporates rapidly, carrying volatile odor compounds with it -- the same principle used in theatrical costume care. Tea tree oil provides residual antimicrobial protection after the alcohol evaporates. Lemon oil cuts through the body oils that bind odor molecules to synthetic fabrics. Eucalyptus oil adds antifungal protection for shoes.

## Tips

- This extends wear by 1-2 uses between washes -- it is not a replacement for laundering.
- Cheap vodka works as well as expensive brands. Avoid flavored vodkas.
- Spray shoes immediately after wearing, before sweat dries.
- Stuff shoes with crumpled newspaper after spraying to wick out moisture.
