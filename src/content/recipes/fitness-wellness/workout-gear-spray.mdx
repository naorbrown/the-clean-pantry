## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of vodka into a clean 8 oz spray bottle. The alcohol acts as both a disinfectant and a carrier that evaporates quickly.
2. Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil, 8 drops of lemon essential oil, and 5 drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Swirl gently to let the alcohol absorb the oils.
3. Add 1/4 cup of distilled water. Secure the spray nozzle and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds.
4. To use on workout clothes, turn garments inside out (where bacteria concentration is highest) and spray a light, even mist over the fabric. Do not saturate.
5. Hang the clothes to air dry. The alcohol-water base evaporates within 15-20 minutes.
6. For shoes, spray 3-4 mists inside each shoe and leave them in a well-ventilated area to dry overnight.

## Why It Works

The vodka (ethanol at 40% concentration) works as a rapid-evaporation antimicrobial solvent. When it evaporates, it carries away volatile odor compounds -- the same principle used in professional theatrical costume care, where costumes cannot be washed between performances. Ethanol also denatures the proteins in odor-causing bacteria, killing them on contact. The fast evaporation rate means fabrics dry quickly and do not develop the musty smell that occurs when damp athletic fabrics sit in enclosed spaces. Tea tree oil provides residual antimicrobial protection that remains on the fabric after the alcohol evaporates, continuing to inhibit bacterial growth between wearings. Lemon oil contributes limonene, a natural terpene that is highly effective at cutting through the lipid-based body oils that bind odor molecules to synthetic athletic fabrics. Eucalyptus oil adds 1,8-cineole for antifungal protection, which is particularly important for shoes.

## Tips

- This spray is designed for between-wash freshening, not as a replacement for laundering. Use it to extend the life of workout clothes between washes by 1-2 additional wearings.
- Cheap vodka works just as well as expensive brands. You need the ethanol, not the flavor. Avoid flavored vodkas as they may contain added sugars.
- Spray shoes immediately after wearing them, before the sweat dries. Bacteria multiply exponentially in the first few hours on damp surfaces.
- For extra odor-fighting power in shoes, stuff them with crumpled newspaper after spraying. The paper wicks moisture out of the shoe interior while the spray handles the bacteria.
