## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle. The witch hazel acts as a dispersant to keep the essential oils from separating.
2. Add 15 drops of lavender essential oil, 5 drops of chamomile essential oil, and 3 drops of cedarwood essential oil if using.
3. Swirl the bottle gently to let the witch hazel absorb the oils.
4. Add 1/4 cup of distilled water. Secure the spray nozzle.
5. Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds to emulsify.
6. To use, shake the bottle and spray 2-3 light mists onto your pillow from about 12 inches away, 10-15 minutes before lying down. This allows the alcohol in witch hazel to evaporate, leaving only the aromatic compounds.

## Why It Works

Lavender essential oil contains linalool and linalyl acetate, two terpene compounds that have been clinically studied for their effects on sleep quality. Linalool interacts with GABA receptors in the brain -- the same receptors targeted by anti-anxiety medications -- producing a mild sedative effect when inhaled. Studies have shown that inhaling lavender before sleep increases the percentage of deep slow-wave sleep and reduces heart rate variability, both markers of better rest. Roman chamomile contains bisabolol and chamazulene, which complement lavender's calming effect by reducing nervous tension. Cedarwood oil contains cedrol, a sesquiterpene alcohol that has been shown to increase parasympathetic nervous system activity, shifting the body from an alert state to a rest-and-digest state. Witch hazel serves as a natural emulsifier, keeping the oil droplets suspended in water so each spray delivers a consistent aromatic dose.

## Tips

- Shake before every use. Essential oils and water separate quickly, and an unshaken spray may deliver an inconsistent amount of fragrance.
- Spray on the underside of your pillowcase or on the top sheet rather than directly on the sleeping surface for a subtler scent that lasts through the night.
- Distilled water is important here because tap water contains minerals and microorganisms that can cause the spray to spoil within days.
- This spray keeps for 2-3 months when made with distilled water. If it develops an off smell, discard and make a fresh batch.
