## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of lavender essential oil, 5 drops of chamomile essential oil, and 3 drops of cedarwood essential oil if using.
3. Swirl gently to combine.
4. Add 1/4 cup of distilled water. Secure the spray nozzle.
5. Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds.
6. Shake and spray 2-3 light mists onto your pillow from 12 inches away, 10-15 minutes before lying down.

## Why It Works

Linalool in lavender interacts with GABA receptors, producing a mild sedative effect that increases deep slow-wave sleep. Roman chamomile reduces nervous tension. Cedarwood increases parasympathetic nervous system activity, shifting the body into rest mode. Witch hazel emulsifies the oils so each spray delivers a consistent dose.

## Tips

- Shake before every use -- oils and water separate quickly.
- Spray the underside of your pillowcase for a subtler scent that lasts through the night.
- Use distilled water -- tap water minerals cause the spray to spoil within days.
- Keeps for 2-3 months. Discard if it develops an off smell.
