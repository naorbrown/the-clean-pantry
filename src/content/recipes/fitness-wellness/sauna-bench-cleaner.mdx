## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1/2 cup of distilled water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of eucalyptus essential oil and 10 drops of tea tree essential oil.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Wait for the fizzing to subside before sealing.
4. Secure the spray nozzle and shake gently.
5. Once the bench has cooled enough to touch, spray generously onto the surface where you sat.
6. Let sit for 2-3 minutes.
7. Wipe down with a clean, dry towel.

## Why It Works

Vinegar kills bacteria and fungi on contact and leaves no chemical residue that could off-gas at sauna temperatures of 150-190 degrees F. Eucalyptus oil provides antimicrobial action with a spa-like scent. Tea tree oil adds antifungal coverage against athlete's foot and ringworm. Baking soda provides mild abrasion and neutralizes the vinegar odor.

## Tips

- Clean benches after every session -- bacteria colonize warm, damp wood within minutes.
- Never use commercial cleaners in a sauna -- heat vaporizes chemical residues into the enclosed air.
- For deep stains, apply a paste of 2 tablespoons baking soda and 1 tablespoon water for 10 minutes, then scrub.
- The vinegar smell dissipates within minutes as the bench dries.
