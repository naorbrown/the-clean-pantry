## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1/2 cup of distilled water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of eucalyptus essential oil and 10 drops of tea tree essential oil.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda. The mixture will fizz briefly as the baking soda reacts with the vinegar. Wait for the fizzing to subside before sealing the bottle.
4. Secure the spray nozzle and shake gently to combine.
5. After your sauna session and once the bench has cooled enough to touch safely, spray the solution generously onto the bench surface where you sat.
6. Let the solution sit for 2-3 minutes to allow the antimicrobial agents to work.
7. Wipe down with a clean, dry towel or cloth. The bench will air-dry quickly in the warm environment.

## Why It Works

Sauna benches collect sweat, dead skin cells, and body oils at temperatures that encourage rapid bacterial growth during cool-down periods. White vinegar contains 5% acetic acid, which kills most common bacteria and fungi on contact by disrupting their cell membranes. Unlike commercial cleaners, vinegar leaves no chemical residue that could off-gas harmful compounds when the sauna is reheated -- this is critical because conventional cleaning products can release volatile organic compounds at sauna temperatures of 150-190°F. Eucalyptus oil provides eucalyptol, a potent antimicrobial compound that also produces a clean, spa-like scent appropriate for sauna environments. Tea tree oil adds broad-spectrum antifungal activity, particularly important for preventing the growth of dermatophytes (the fungi responsible for athlete's foot and ringworm) that thrive in warm, moist environments. The small amount of baking soda provides mild abrasive cleaning power and helps neutralize the sharp vinegar odor.

## Tips

- Clean benches after every session, not just when they look dirty. Bacteria begin colonizing warm, damp wood within minutes of exposure to sweat.
- Never use commercial multi-surface cleaners in a sauna. The heat vaporizes chemical residues, and you will inhale them in the enclosed space.
- For deep stains or heavy buildup, make a paste with 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of water. Apply to the stain, let sit for 10 minutes, then scrub with a soft brush before spraying with the cleaning solution.
- The vinegar smell dissipates within minutes as the bench dries. When the sauna is reheated, only the pleasant eucalyptus and tea tree scent remains.
