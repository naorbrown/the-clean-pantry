## Steps

1. In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of activated charcoal powder if using. Stir until evenly blended.
2. Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil and 5 drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Mix thoroughly, breaking up any clumps that form around the oil drops.
3. If using dried lavender buds, fold them into the mixture.
4. Divide the mixture evenly between 2 muslin bags, clean old socks, or small squares of breathable fabric tied with string.
5. Place one sachet at the bottom of your gym bag and tuck the second into your shoe compartment or between your workout shoes.
6. Refresh the sachets every 2-3 weeks by opening them and adding 5 drops each of tea tree and eucalyptus oil. Replace the entire mixture monthly.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) neutralizes odors through an acid-base reaction. Gym bag smells are largely caused by short-chain fatty acids -- particularly isovaleric acid -- produced when bacteria on the skin metabolize sweat. These acids are, as the name implies, acidic, and baking soda's alkaline pH of 8.3 neutralizes them on contact, converting them to odorless sodium salts. Activated charcoal works through physical adsorption: its extremely porous structure (one gram has a surface area of roughly 3,000 square meters) traps volatile odor molecules in its microscopic pores. Tea tree oil provides ongoing antimicrobial action, killing the odor-causing bacteria that transfer from gym clothes and shoes into the bag. Eucalyptus oil contributes eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), which has both antimicrobial properties and a clean, sharp scent that masks residual odor.

## Tips

- Place sachets in your bag immediately after emptying dirty clothes, not just during storage. Odor-causing bacteria colonize bag fabric within hours.
- For an emergency gym bag refresh between sachet replacements, sprinkle a tablespoon of plain baking soda directly onto the bag interior, let it sit overnight, then shake it out.
- Double-bag the activated charcoal version inside a second layer of fabric if you use a light-colored gym bag. Charcoal dust can seep through single layers of muslin.
- If you prefer not to use essential oils, the baking soda and activated charcoal alone provide significant odor control. The oils add antimicrobial action and pleasant scent but are not strictly necessary.
