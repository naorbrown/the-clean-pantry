## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of activated charcoal powder if using. Stir until blended.
2. Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil and 5 drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Mix thoroughly, breaking up any clumps.
3. Fold in dried lavender buds if using.
4. Divide evenly between 2 muslin bags, clean old socks, or breathable fabric squares tied with string.
5. Place one sachet at the bottom of your gym bag and tuck the second into your shoe compartment.
6. Refresh every 2-3 weeks by adding 5 drops each of tea tree and eucalyptus oil. Replace the entire mixture monthly.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes the short-chain fatty acids that cause gym bag odor, converting them to odorless sodium salts. Activated charcoal traps volatile odor molecules in its microscopic pores. Tea tree oil kills odor-causing bacteria. Eucalyptus oil adds antimicrobial coverage and a clean scent.

## Tips

- Place sachets in your bag immediately after emptying dirty clothes -- bacteria colonize bag fabric within hours.
- For an emergency refresh, sprinkle baking soda directly onto the bag interior, leave overnight, and shake out.
- Double-bag the charcoal version if you use a light-colored gym bag -- charcoal dust seeps through single muslin layers.
- Baking soda and charcoal alone provide good odor control if you prefer to skip essential oils.
