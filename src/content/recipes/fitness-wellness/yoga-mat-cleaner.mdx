## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of distilled water.
3. Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil.
4. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake well to combine.
5. After each yoga session, lay your mat flat and spray a light, even mist over the entire surface you used.
6. Let the spray sit for 1 to 2 minutes.
7. Wipe the mat down with a clean, dry cloth or let it air dry completely before rolling it up.

## Why It Works

Tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound with demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal properties. This is particularly relevant for yoga mats, which collect sweat, skin cells, and warmth -- ideal conditions for bacteria and fungal growth. Witch hazel is a natural astringent that helps the solution spread evenly across the mat surface and aids in lifting body oils out of the mat material. Unlike rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, witch hazel does not degrade TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) or PVC mat surfaces over time. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits from forming on the mat surface, which can make it slippery.

## Tips

- Always use alcohol-free witch hazel. Alcohol-based formulations can dry out and crack natural rubber and TPE mats with repeated use.
- Clean your mat after every session, not just when it looks or smells dirty. Bacteria colonies can establish within hours on a warm, damp surface.
- For a deeper monthly clean, wipe the entire mat with a cloth dampened with plain white vinegar, then follow with the spray. The vinegar provides a more thorough disinfection.
- This spray has a shelf life of about 4 to 6 weeks. Essential oils oxidize over time and lose their antimicrobial potency. Make small batches and use them up.
- Store the spray in a dark-colored bottle or keep it out of direct sunlight. UV light degrades tea tree oil.

## Alternative

- Replace tea tree oil with 10 drops of eucalyptus essential oil if you prefer a different scent. Eucalyptus contains eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), which has similar antimicrobial properties.
- For a completely oil-free version, substitute 2 tablespoons of white vinegar for the essential oils. The mat will smell like vinegar briefly, but the scent dissipates within minutes as the mat dries.
