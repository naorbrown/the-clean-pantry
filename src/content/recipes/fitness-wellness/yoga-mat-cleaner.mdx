## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of distilled water.
3. Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil.
4. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake well.
5. After each session, lay your mat flat and spray a light mist over the entire surface.
6. Let sit for 1-2 minutes.
7. Wipe with a dry cloth or air dry completely before rolling up.

## Why It Works

Tea tree oil kills bacteria and fungi that thrive on sweaty mats. Witch hazel spreads the solution evenly and lifts body oils without degrading TPE or PVC the way rubbing alcohol does. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits that can make the mat slippery.

## Alternative

- Replace tea tree with 10 drops of eucalyptus oil for a different scent with similar antimicrobial properties.
- For an oil-free version, substitute 2 tablespoons of white vinegar for the essential oils. The vinegar scent dissipates within minutes.

## Tips

- Always use alcohol-free witch hazel -- alcohol formulations crack rubber and TPE mats over time.
- Clean after every session, not just when it smells.
- Shelf life is 4-6 weeks. Make small batches.
- Store in a dark bottle or out of direct sunlight -- UV degrades tea tree oil.
