## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.
3. Add 8 drops of lemongrass essential oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil.
4. Secure the spray nozzle and shake well for 10-15 seconds to combine.
5. After each use, spray a light, even mist over the entire surface of your foam roller, yoga blocks, bolsters, or straps.
6. Let the spray sit for 1-2 minutes.
7. Wipe down with a clean cloth or allow to air dry completely before storing.

## Why It Works

Foam rollers and yoga blocks are made from open-cell or closed-cell EVA foam and similar materials that absorb sweat and body oils during use. The porous surface texture that provides grip also creates micro-environments where bacteria thrive. Witch hazel contains hamamelitannin, a natural astringent that helps lift body oils from foam surfaces without degrading the material. Unlike rubbing alcohol, which dries out and cracks EVA foam over time, witch hazel cleans without stripping the foam's structural integrity. White vinegar provides acetic acid for antimicrobial action against the bacteria species most commonly found on shared fitness equipment. Lemongrass essential oil contains citral, a compound with strong antibacterial and antifungal properties that also provides a clean, energizing scent. Lavender oil adds linalool for additional antimicrobial coverage and a calming aromatic quality suited to yoga practice environments.

## Tips

- For deeply soiled foam rollers, fill a basin with warm water, add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and submerge the roller for 5 minutes. Squeeze out excess water and allow to air dry completely -- this may take 24 hours for open-cell foam.
- Never use bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol on foam props. These chemicals break down the foam structure, causing it to crumble and lose its firmness.
- Clean your foam roller after every use, especially if you roll on bare skin. Skin oils seep into the foam and create a persistent odor that is very difficult to remove once established.
- If using shared yoga props in a studio, spray before and after use. The quick-drying formula means props are ready within minutes.
