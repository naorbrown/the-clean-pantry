## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.
3. Add 8 drops of lemongrass essential oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil.
4. Secure the spray nozzle and shake well for 10-15 seconds.
5. After each use, spray a light, even mist over the entire surface.
6. Let sit for 1-2 minutes.
7. Wipe down with a clean cloth or air dry completely before storing.

## Why It Works

Witch hazel lifts body oils from foam without degrading it the way rubbing alcohol does. White vinegar provides antimicrobial action against bacteria common on fitness equipment. Lemongrass oil adds antibacterial and antifungal coverage. Lavender oil contributes additional antimicrobial protection.

## Tips

- For deeply soiled rollers, submerge in warm water with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar for 5 minutes. Air drying open-cell foam may take 24 hours.
- Never use bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol on foam props -- they break down the foam structure.
- Clean after every use, especially if rolling on bare skin.
- For shared studio props, spray before and after use.
