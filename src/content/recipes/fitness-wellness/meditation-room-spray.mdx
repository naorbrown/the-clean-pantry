## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of frankincense essential oil and 5 drops of sandalwood essential oil.
3. If using, add 3 drops of clary sage essential oil and 3 drops of orange essential oil.
4. Swirl gently to allow the witch hazel to absorb the essential oils.
5. Add 1/4 cup of distilled water. Secure the spray nozzle and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds.
6. To use, shake the bottle and spray 3-4 mists into the air in your meditation space 5 minutes before beginning your practice. The scent creates an aromatic anchor that helps signal the brain to transition into a focused, calm state.

## Why It Works

Frankincense (Boswellia sacra) essential oil contains incensole acetate, a compound that activates ion channels in the brain associated with anxiety reduction and mood elevation. For centuries, frankincense resin has been burned in religious and contemplative settings, and modern research confirms its psychoactive effects when inhaled. Sandalwood oil contains alpha-santalol, which has been shown in clinical studies to reduce systolic blood pressure and lower cortisol levels -- both physiological markers of stress reduction. Clary sage provides linalyl acetate, the same calming compound found in lavender, which promotes parasympathetic nervous system activation. Orange oil contributes limonene, a terpene with mild mood-lifting effects that prevents the blend from becoming too heavy or sedating. Together, these oils create a balanced aromatic profile: grounding base notes (sandalwood, frankincense), calming middle notes (clary sage), and bright top notes (orange).

## Tips

- Spray into the air, not onto meditation cushions or yoga mats. Essential oils can stain fabric and degrade rubber or foam mat surfaces.
- Using the same scent consistently during meditation creates an olfactory anchor. Over time, smelling this spray alone will trigger your brain to shift toward a meditative state faster.
- Store in a dark glass bottle away from sunlight. Frankincense and sandalwood oils are expensive and degrade when exposed to UV light.
- This spray doubles as a general calming room spray for offices, bedrooms, or any space where you want to reduce stress and create a sense of focus.
