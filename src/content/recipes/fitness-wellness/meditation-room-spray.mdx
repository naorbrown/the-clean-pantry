## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of frankincense essential oil and 5 drops of sandalwood essential oil.
3. If using, add 3 drops of clary sage essential oil and 3 drops of orange essential oil.
4. Swirl gently to combine the oils with the witch hazel.
5. Add 1/4 cup of distilled water. Secure the spray nozzle and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds.
6. Shake and spray 3-4 mists into the air 5 minutes before beginning your practice.

## Why It Works

Frankincense activates brain ion channels associated with anxiety reduction. Sandalwood reduces blood pressure and cortisol levels. Clary sage promotes parasympathetic nervous system activation. Orange oil adds a mild mood lift that prevents the blend from becoming too heavy.

## Tips

- Spray into the air, not onto cushions or mats -- essential oils can stain fabric and degrade foam.
- Using the same scent consistently creates an olfactory anchor that deepens over time.
- Store in a dark glass bottle away from sunlight to preserve expensive oils.
- Doubles as a calming spray for offices or bedrooms.
