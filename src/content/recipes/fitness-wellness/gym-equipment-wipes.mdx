## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of distilled water in a large bowl.
2. Add 15 drops of tea tree essential oil and 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap. Stir gently.
3. Stack the cotton cloths or flannel squares in a wide-mouth mason jar or airtight container.
4. Pour the solution over the cloths, pressing down so each one absorbs evenly.
5. Seal and let soak for at least 30 minutes before first use.
6. Pull one wipe, wring out excess, and wipe down the equipment surface.
7. Let the surface air dry for 30 seconds before use.
8. Place dirty wipes in a separate bag for laundering. Wash in hot water with no fabric softener.

## Why It Works

Vinegar kills common gym-surface bacteria including staphylococcus and E. coli. Tea tree oil adds broad-spectrum antifungal coverage against ringworm and athlete's foot. Castile soap cuts through sweat, body oil, and chalk residue without the skin-irritating chemicals found in disposable gym wipes.

## Alternative

- Substitute 70% isopropyl alcohol for the vinegar for faster evaporation and stronger disinfection, though it is harsher on skin and dries out vinyl surfaces.
- For a fragrance-free version, omit the tea tree oil and increase vinegar to 1 1/4 cups.

## Tips

- Make a fresh batch every 2 weeks -- oils lose potency and the solution can grow bacteria if stored too long.
- Never add fabric softener when laundering wipes -- it coats fibers and reduces absorbency.
- For a home gym, keep a container near each workout station.
- Works on vinyl benches, steel dumbbells, and plastic-coated cable handles.
