## Steps

1. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of distilled water.
2. Add 15 drops of tea tree essential oil and 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap. Stir gently to combine.
3. Fold the cotton cloths or flannel squares and stack them in a wide-mouth mason jar or airtight container.
4. Pour the cleaning solution over the stacked cloths, pressing down to ensure each cloth absorbs the liquid evenly.
5. Seal the container and let the cloths soak for at least 30 minutes before first use.
6. To use, pull one wipe from the container, wring out excess liquid, and wipe down the equipment surface.
7. Allow the surface to air dry for 30 seconds before using the equipment.
8. After use, place the dirty wipe in a separate bag or bin for laundering. Wash in hot water with no fabric softener and tumble dry on high heat.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid at a 5% concentration kills many common bacteria found on gym surfaces, including staphylococcus and E. coli. Tea tree oil adds broad-spectrum antifungal coverage, which is important in gym environments where ringworm and athlete's foot fungi thrive on shared equipment. Castile soap acts as a surfactant that helps the solution cut through the combination of sweat, body oil, and chalk residue that accumulates on weights and benches. Unlike disposable gym wipes that contain quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) and synthetic fragrances, these reusable wipes avoid chemicals that can irritate skin during direct contact with equipment you grip and press against.

## Alternative

- Substitute rubbing alcohol (70% isopropyl) for the vinegar if you need faster evaporation and stronger disinfection. Isopropyl alcohol kills bacteria and viruses on contact and evaporates within seconds, but it is harsher on skin with repeated exposure and will dry out vinyl bench surfaces over time.
- For a fragrance-free version, omit the tea tree oil and increase the vinegar to 1 1/4 cups. The solution will be slightly more acidic but still safe for metal and vinyl surfaces.
## Tips

- Keep a sealed container of these wipes in your gym bag for wiping down equipment at commercial gyms. The sealed container prevents evaporation during transport.
- Make a fresh batch of solution every 2 weeks. The essential oils lose potency over time, and the solution can develop bacterial growth if stored too long.
- Do not add fabric softener when laundering the wipes. Fabric softener coats fibers with a waxy residue that reduces absorbency and prevents the cleaning solution from saturating the cloth properly.
- For a home gym, keep a container near each workout station so you are more likely to wipe down equipment immediately after use.
- These wipes work on vinyl and faux-leather bench surfaces, steel dumbbells, and plastic-coated cable handles.
