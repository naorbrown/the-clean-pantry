## Steps

1. Disassemble the bottle completely -- remove the lid, gasket, straw, bite valve, and any removable parts.
2. Soak the small parts in a bowl with 1 tablespoon baking soda, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and enough hot water to cover. Soak 20 minutes.
3. Add 1 tablespoon each of baking soda, coarse salt, and uncooked rice to the bottle.
4. Pour in 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Let it fizz.
5. Add hot water (around 140 degrees F) until three-quarters full.
6. Cap and shake vigorously for 30 seconds.
7. Let sit for 15 minutes.
8. Empty and rinse 3-4 times until no vinegar smell remains.
9. Scrub straws and bite valves with a pipe cleaner after soaking.
10. Air dry all parts completely on a drying rack before reassembling.

## Why It Works

The baking soda and vinegar reaction produces CO2 gas that physically lifts biofilm -- the slimy bacterial layer resistant to normal rinsing. Salt and rice provide abrasive scrubbing where a brush cannot reach. Baking soda disrupts bacterial cell walls, while vinegar dissolves mineral deposits from hard water and electrolyte mixes.

## Alternative

- For a quicker daily clean, shake hot water with 1 teaspoon of baking soda, let sit 5 minutes, and rinse.
- Denture cleaning tablets work on the same principle -- drop one into the bottle with hot water and soak 30 minutes.

## Tips

- Deep clean at least once a week. A daily soap rinse does not prevent biofilm.
- The rubber gasket is the most common mold location -- replace it if odor persists after cleaning.
- Stainless steel bottles can handle water up to 180 degrees F. Keep plastic and Tritan bottles below 140.
- Never put insulated bottles in the dishwasher -- the heat can compromise the vacuum seal.
