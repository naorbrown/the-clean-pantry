## Steps

1. Disassemble the bottle completely -- remove the lid, gasket, straw, bite valve, and any other removable parts.
2. Place the small parts (gasket, straw, bite valve) in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Add enough hot water to cover the parts and let them soak for 20 minutes.
3. In the bottle itself, add 1 tablespoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of coarse salt, and 1 tablespoon of uncooked rice (for narrow-mouth bottles).
4. Pour 2 tablespoons of vinegar into the bottle. It will fizz -- this is normal and helps dislodge buildup from the interior walls.
5. Add hot water (around 140 degrees F) until the bottle is about three-quarters full.
6. Cap or cover the bottle opening and shake vigorously for 30 seconds. The salt and rice act as abrasives that scrub the interior walls where a brush cannot reach.
7. Let the solution sit in the bottle for 15 minutes.
8. Empty the bottle and rinse 3 to 4 times with clean water until no residue or vinegar smell remains.
9. Use a thin brush or pipe cleaner to scrub the inside of straws and bite valves after soaking.
10. Allow all parts to air dry completely on a drying rack before reassembling. Never store a bottle sealed while still damp.

## Why It Works

The combination of baking soda and vinegar creates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas. This fizzing action physically lifts biofilm -- the slimy bacterial layer that forms inside water bottles, especially around gaskets, straw connections, and the waterline. Biofilm is resistant to simple rinsing and even to many dish soaps because the bacterial colony secretes a protective polysaccharide matrix. The mechanical agitation from the CO2 bubbles combined with the abrasive scrubbing of salt and rice breaks through this matrix. The alkalinity of baking soda (pH 8.3) further disrupts bacterial cell walls, while vinegar's acidity dissolves mineral deposits left by hard water and electrolyte drink mixes.

## Tips

- Deep clean your water bottle at least once a week if you use it daily. A quick rinse with soap after each use is not enough to prevent biofilm formation.
- Pay special attention to the rubber gasket in the lid. This is the most common location for mold and bacterial growth because it traps moisture and is difficult to dry completely.
- If your bottle has a persistent musty smell even after cleaning, the gasket likely needs to be replaced. Most bottle manufacturers sell replacement gaskets for a few dollars.
- Stainless steel bottles can handle hotter water (up to 180 degrees F) for a more aggressive clean. Plastic and Tritan bottles should stay below 140 degrees F.
- Never put insulated (double-walled) bottles in the dishwasher. The heat and water pressure can compromise the vacuum seal between the walls, ruining the insulation.

## Alternative

- For a quicker daily clean, fill the bottle with hot water and 1 teaspoon of baking soda, shake, let it sit for 5 minutes, and rinse. This is less thorough than the full deep-clean method but is effective for maintenance between weekly deep cleans.
- Denture cleaning tablets (effervescent sodium bicarbonate tablets) work on the same principle and can be dropped into the bottle with hot water for a hands-off approach. Use one tablet per bottle and soak for 30 minutes.
