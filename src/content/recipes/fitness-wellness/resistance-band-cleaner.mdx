## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of unscented liquid castile soap.
3. Add 8 drops of tea tree essential oil and 4 drops of peppermint essential oil if using.
4. Secure the spray nozzle and shake gently to combine. Avoid shaking too vigorously as the castile soap will create excessive foam.
5. After each workout, lay your resistance bands flat and spray a light mist over the entire surface. For dumbbells, kettlebells, or other equipment, spray directly onto the handles and grip surfaces.
6. Let the solution sit for 30-60 seconds.
7. Wipe down with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. For bands, pat dry and hang to air dry completely before storing.

## Why It Works

Resistance bands and exercise equipment collect a combination of sweat, body oils, skin cells, and environmental bacteria with every use. The warm, moist conditions during a workout create an ideal growth medium for bacteria and fungi. White vinegar's acetic acid disrupts bacterial cell walls on contact, providing effective sanitation without the harsh chemicals found in commercial gym wipes that can degrade rubber and latex. Castile soap is made from plant oils and is gentle enough for latex while still acting as a surfactant that lifts body oils and grime off equipment surfaces. Unlike petroleum-based detergents, castile soap rinses clean and does not leave a slippery residue on grip surfaces -- an important safety consideration for equipment you hold during exercise. Tea tree oil provides additional broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly found on gym equipment.

## Tips

- Always dry bands completely before rolling or storing them. Storing damp latex bands in a dark bag creates conditions for mold growth and accelerates material degradation.
- For textured grip surfaces on dumbbells or kettlebells, use a soft-bristled brush (an old toothbrush works well) to work the cleaning solution into the grooves.
- Clean bands after every single use. Sweat contains salt that dries on the latex surface, creating micro-abrasions that weaken the band over time.
- This cleaner also works well on jump ropes, pull-up assist bands, and suspension trainer straps. Avoid using it on leather gym accessories -- leather requires oil-based conditioning instead.
