## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of unscented liquid castile soap.
3. Add 8 drops of tea tree essential oil and 4 drops of peppermint essential oil if using.
4. Secure the spray nozzle and shake gently. Avoid vigorous shaking -- castile soap foams easily.
5. Spray a light mist over bands laid flat, or directly onto dumbbell and kettlebell handles.
6. Let sit for 30-60 seconds.
7. Wipe with a dry microfiber cloth. Pat bands dry and hang to air dry completely before storing.

## Why It Works

Vinegar disrupts bacterial cell walls without degrading rubber and latex like commercial gym wipes can. Castile soap lifts body oils and grime with no slippery residue on grip surfaces. Tea tree oil adds broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

## Tips

- Always dry bands completely before storing -- damp latex in a dark bag grows mold and degrades faster.
- For textured grips, use an old toothbrush to work the solution into grooves.
- Clean bands after every use -- dried sweat salt creates micro-abrasions that weaken latex.
- Also works on jump ropes, pull-up assist bands, and suspension trainer straps. Not for leather accessories.
