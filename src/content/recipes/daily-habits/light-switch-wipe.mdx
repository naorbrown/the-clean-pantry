## Steps

1. Mix 1/4 cup of white vinegar with 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl.
2. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution and wring it out thoroughly -- the cloth should be barely damp.
3. Wipe the face plate and toggle of each light switch, pressing the cloth into the crevice around the toggle where grime accumulates.
4. For rocker-style switches and dimmer knobs, wipe the entire surface including the edges.
5. Use a cotton swab dipped in the solution to clean the narrow gaps between the switch and the plate, and around the edges of outlet covers.
6. Wipe dry with a clean cloth immediately.

## Why It Works

Light switches are touched by every person in the household multiple times per day, often with unwashed hands. They accumulate a visible layer of finger oils, skin cells, and bacteria over time -- the yellowish discoloration around frequently used switches is mostly oxidized body oil. The vinegar solution dissolves this oily film and reduces bacterial contamination. Using a barely damp cloth and cotton swabs allows thorough cleaning without any risk of moisture entering the electrical components behind the plate.

## Tips

- Clean light switches weekly. They are one of the most overlooked high-touch surfaces in any home.
- Focus on the switches you use most: bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and hallway.
- If the switch plates are visibly yellowed and cleaning does not restore them, replacing the plates is inexpensive -- standard plates cost under a dollar each and swap out with a single screwdriver.
- Smart switches and dimmer panels with flat touch surfaces are easier to keep clean than traditional toggle switches. A single wipe covers the whole surface.
- For homes with young children, pay extra attention to outlet covers and the switches at child height. These tend to accumulate more grime from sticky hands.
