## Steps

1. Fill a large basin or clean sink with 1 gallon of warm water.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of unscented castile soap and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. Stir to dissolve.
3. Turn fabric bags inside out and submerge them in the solution.
4. Gently agitate each bag by hand, paying attention to the bottom corners and seams where food residue collects.
5. Let the bags soak for 15-20 minutes.
6. Drain the solution and rinse each bag under clean running water until the water runs clear.
7. Hang the bags to dry completely -- outdoors in sunlight is ideal, or on a drying rack indoors. Do not use them until fully dry.

## Why It Works

A study from the University of Arizona and Loma Linda University found that nearly all reusable grocery bags tested contained significant levels of bacteria, including coliform bacteria in over half the bags and E. coli in 12% of them. The contamination comes from raw meat juices, produce residues, and general food handling. Castile soap's surfactants lift and suspend the organic matter (food residue, oils) that bacteria feed on, while vinegar provides mild antimicrobial action and neutralizes odors. The combination of mechanical agitation, soap, and acidic rinse brings bacterial counts down dramatically.

## Tips

- Wash your reusable bags at least once per week if you shop regularly, or after every trip that includes raw meat or seafood.
- Insulated or laminated bags (the kind with a shiny interior lining) should be wiped inside with the solution rather than soaked, as prolonged soaking can delaminate the lining.
- Designate one bag specifically for raw meat and label it. This prevents cross-contamination with bags used for produce and ready-to-eat items.
- Cotton and canvas bags can also be machine washed on a warm cycle as an alternative to hand washing.
- Dry bags completely before folding and storing. Damp, folded bags develop mold and mildew quickly in warm environments.
