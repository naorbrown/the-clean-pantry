## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of tea tree essential oil.
3. Shake well to combine.
4. Take the entryway mat outside or to a hard floor surface. Spray the mat thoroughly on both sides until damp.
5. Let the mat air dry completely before placing it back at the door.
6. For shoe soles, flip shoes upside down and spray the bottoms generously. Let them air dry on a newspaper or towel near the door.

## Why It Works

Shoe soles are one of the most contaminated surfaces that regularly enter your home. Studies from the University of Arizona found that the average shoe sole carries over 400,000 bacteria, including E. coli, Klebsiella, and Serratia. Shoes also track in pesticide residues, lead dust, and other environmental contaminants. The acetic acid in vinegar kills many common bacteria on contact, while tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) provides additional antimicrobial and antifungal action through its terpinen-4-ol content. Regular disinfection of the mat and shoe soles at the point of entry reduces what gets walked into the rest of the house.

## Tips

- Spray the mat 2-3 times per week if your household uses it daily. Once per week is sufficient for less-trafficked doors.
- Shake out or vacuum the mat before spraying to remove loose dirt and debris. The spray works best on a clean surface.
- For rubber-backed mats, spray only the top surface. Vinegar will not damage rubber, but saturation is unnecessary.
- If you have pets that walk on the mat, substitute lemon essential oil for tea tree oil -- lemon is safer around most pets while still providing antimicrobial benefits.
- Consider keeping a dedicated pair of indoor shoes or slippers at the entryway so outdoor shoes never go beyond the mat area.
