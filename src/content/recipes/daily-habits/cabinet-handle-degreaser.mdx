## Steps

1. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of water to form a thick paste.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. The mixture will fizz briefly -- this is normal.
3. Stir until you have a slightly gritty but spreadable paste.
4. Apply the paste to a soft cloth or directly onto the cabinet handle with your fingers.
5. Rub the paste over the handle, paying attention to the underside and the area where the handle meets the cabinet face -- this is where grease accumulates most.
6. Let the paste sit for 2-3 minutes on particularly grimy handles.
7. Wipe clean with a damp cloth, rinsing the cloth as needed.
8. Dry with a clean cloth to prevent water spots.

## Why It Works

Kitchen cabinet handles accumulate cooking grease, food oils, and residue from unwashed hands. Bathroom hardware collects hand lotion, soap residue, and body oils. This combination works through two mechanisms: baking soda is a mild abrasive that physically scrubs away stuck-on grease without scratching metal or painted finishes, while its alkalinity (pH ~8.3) helps break down fatty acids in cooking oils. The vinegar adds acetic acid, which cuts through soap scum and water mineral deposits common on bathroom hardware. Together, they handle both kitchen grease and bathroom grime.

## Tips

- Clean cabinet handles every 1-2 weeks. The handles nearest the stove and oven accumulate grease fastest and may need weekly attention.
- For a quicker routine maintenance wipe between deep cleans, a spray of straight vinegar and water (50/50) with a microfiber cloth is usually sufficient.
- If handles have intricate detailing or grooves, use an old toothbrush with the paste to get into the crevices.
- Stainless steel and chrome handles respond particularly well to this treatment and come out with a nice shine.
- Do not forget the handles on appliances -- oven, dishwasher, refrigerator, and microwave handles get just as greasy as cabinet pulls.
