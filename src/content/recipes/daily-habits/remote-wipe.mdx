## Steps

1. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a 4 oz spray bottle.
2. Spray 2-3 mists onto a clean microfiber cloth -- it should be lightly damp, not wet.
3. Wipe the entire surface of the remote control or controller, including the top, sides, bottom, and around all buttons.
4. Use a cotton swab dipped in the solution to clean between and around buttons where crumbs, skin oils, and dust accumulate in the crevices.
5. Use a dry cotton swab to clean out the button gaps after the damp swab.
6. Wipe the entire device once more with the dry side of the microfiber cloth.
7. Repeat for game controllers, streaming device remotes, and any other handheld electronics.

## Why It Works

Remote controls are handled by every household member, often while eating, and rarely cleaned. A study from the University of Virginia found that TV remote controls were among the most contaminated surfaces in homes with sick family members, carrying significant levels of rhinovirus. The recessed areas around buttons trap food particles, dead skin cells, and oils that feed bacterial growth. The vinegar solution dissolves the oily grime while the cotton swab technique physically removes trapped debris from crevices that a flat cloth cannot reach.

## Tips

- Clean remotes and controllers weekly, or immediately when someone in the household is sick.
- For heavily soiled remotes with visible grime in the button gaps, use a wooden toothpick wrapped in a thin layer of microfiber cloth to scrape out caked-on debris before wiping.
- If the buttons feel sticky, the likely cause is sugary drink or food residue. A cotton swab with a tiny amount of isopropyl alcohol works better than vinegar for sticky residue.
- Consider keeping one of those small silicone remote covers on your TV remote -- they can be removed and washed in soapy water, keeping the remote itself cleaner.
- Do not forget other overlooked electronics: smart home displays, e-readers, garage door openers, and thermostat controls.
