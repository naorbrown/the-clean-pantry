## Steps

1. Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of water in an 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Spray a small amount onto a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel.
3. Wipe each doorknob and handle thoroughly, rotating the cloth to use a clean section for each knob.
4. Pay attention to both sides of the knob -- the side you grab to open and the side you push to close.
5. No rinsing needed. The vinegar smell dissipates within minutes as the surface dries.

## Why It Works

Door handles are among the highest-touch surfaces in any home, contacted dozens of times daily by every household member. Studies have shown that bacteria and viruses transfer readily between hands and hard surfaces, and that door handles are consistent hotspots for microbial contamination. White vinegar's acetic acid disrupts the cell membranes of many common bacteria including E. coli and Salmonella. While vinegar is not a registered disinfectant and does not kill all pathogens, regular wiping reduces bacterial load substantially and removes the oily residue from hands that bacteria colonize.

## Tips

- Make this a quick daily habit -- it takes less than 2 minutes to wipe down every doorknob in a typical home.
- Focus on the highest-traffic handles: front door, bathroom, kitchen, refrigerator, and bedroom doors.
- For stainless steel or chrome finishes, the vinegar solution also leaves a streak-free shine.
- If you have brass hardware, use a solution of castile soap and water instead -- 1 teaspoon of castile soap in 1 cup of water.
- Keep the spray bottle near your entryway or in a cleaning caddy you carry room to room for convenience.
