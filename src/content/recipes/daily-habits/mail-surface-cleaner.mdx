## Steps

1. Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of water in an 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Clear the mail landing zone of any papers, packages, and items.
3. Spray the surface lightly with the vinegar solution.
4. Wipe with a clean microfiber cloth, working from back to front to push any crumbs or debris off the edge.
5. Let the surface air dry or wipe dry with a clean cloth.

## Why It Works

The spot where you drop mail and packages is a transition zone between the outside world and your home. Packages sit on delivery trucks, warehouse floors, and porches. Mail passes through multiple hands and sorting machines. The surface where these items land accumulates dust, pollen, shipping residue, and bacteria that then transfer to your hands the next time you touch that surface. Vinegar's acetic acid cuts through the oily film that accumulates on frequently used surfaces and reduces bacterial load. Regular wiping keeps this high-traffic zone from becoming a source of contamination.

## Tips

- Wipe the landing zone daily or every time you bring in mail and packages. It takes 30 seconds.
- If your landing zone is a stone surface, use 1 teaspoon of castile soap in 1 cup of water instead of vinegar.
- Consider placing a washable tray or mat on the landing zone to contain any dirt from packages. The tray can be washed in the sink.
- Break down and recycle cardboard boxes outside when possible rather than bringing them further into the house. Cardboard can harbor cockroach eggs and other pests from warehouses.
- Keep the spray bottle stored right at the landing zone for convenience -- you are more likely to use it if it is within arm's reach.
