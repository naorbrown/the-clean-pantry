## Steps

1. Mix 1 oz of distilled water with 1 oz of 70% isopropyl alcohol in a small (2 oz) spray bottle.
2. Power off the phone or tablet, or at minimum lock the screen.
3. Spray a light mist onto a clean microfiber cloth -- 2-3 sprays is sufficient. Never spray directly onto the device.
4. Wipe the screen gently in one direction (not circular motions) starting from the top and working down.
5. Flip the cloth to a dry side and buff lightly to remove any remaining moisture or streaks.
6. Wipe the back and sides of the device while you have the cloth out.

## Why It Works

Phone screens are among the dirtiest objects we handle daily. Studies have found that the average smartphone screen harbors more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. The 50/50 mixture of isopropyl alcohol and distilled water is the same ratio recommended by Apple, Samsung, and most major device manufacturers for safe screen cleaning. The alcohol dissolves fingerprint oils and kills bacteria on contact, while distilled water prevents the mineral spots that tap water leaves behind. A 70% alcohol concentration is effective without being so strong that it damages oleophobic (fingerprint-resistant) coatings.

## Tips

- Clean your phone screen at least once daily. If you think about how often you touch it and then touch your face, daily cleaning is reasonable hygiene.
- Always use a microfiber cloth, never paper towels or tissues. Paper products contain wood fibers that can micro-scratch the screen over time.
- Do not use higher-concentration alcohol (90%+) regularly. While it dries faster, it strips the oleophobic coating more aggressively and can cause the screen to feel rough and attract fingerprints more easily.
- Avoid household glass cleaners like Windex on phone screens. They contain ammonia, which damages the oleophobic coating.
- Keep the small spray bottle and a dedicated microfiber cloth together in a consistent spot -- a desk drawer or nightstand -- so the cleaning habit becomes automatic.
