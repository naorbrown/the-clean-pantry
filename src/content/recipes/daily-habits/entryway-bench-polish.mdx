## Steps

1. Combine 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of white vinegar in a small jar or bowl. Stir or shake to combine. The mixture will not fully emulsify -- this is normal.
2. Dust the bench or furniture piece with a dry microfiber cloth first to remove loose dirt and debris.
3. Dip a clean, soft cloth into the polish mixture and wring out any excess.
4. Rub the polish onto the wood surface in the direction of the grain, using long, even strokes.
5. Work in small sections, applying a thin, even layer. You want a light coating, not a thick film.
6. Let the polish sit for 2-3 minutes.
7. Buff the surface with a clean, dry cloth until it has an even sheen with no oily residue.

## Why It Works

Wood entryway furniture takes constant abuse from shoes, bags, wet coats, and daily use. The vinegar in this polish cuts through accumulated grime, water spots, and sticky residue, while the olive oil penetrates the wood surface to restore moisture and create a thin protective layer. This combination cleans and conditions in one step. The oil fills in micro-scratches, making them less visible, and adds a warm luster that commercial spray polishes (which often contain silicone) do not provide. Unlike silicone-based polishes that sit on top of the wood and build up over time, olive oil absorbs into the finish.

## Tips

- Polish entryway furniture once per month, or whenever it looks dry or dull. High-traffic pieces may benefit from every 2-3 weeks.
- Stir or shake the mixture before each use -- the oil and vinegar separate quickly.
- Use only a small amount. Excess oil leaves a tacky residue that attracts dust. If the surface feels sticky after buffing, you used too much -- wipe down with a cloth dampened with plain vinegar to remove the excess.
- This polish works on sealed, varnished, or lacquered wood. For raw or wax-finished wood, use food-grade mineral oil or beeswax paste instead.
- Store leftover polish in a sealed jar at room temperature for up to 2 months.
