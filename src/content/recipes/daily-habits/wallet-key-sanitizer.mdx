## Steps

1. Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of water in an 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Spray a light mist onto a clean microfiber cloth.
3. Wipe down your keys thoroughly, including the key shaft, head, and key ring. For keys with textured or grooved heads, use the cloth to work into the ridges.
4. Wipe down your wallet exterior. For fabric, nylon, or synthetic wallets, wipe all outer surfaces. For leather wallets, skip the vinegar and use a cloth dampened with plain water only.
5. Wipe down any other everyday carry items: sunglasses frames, badge holders, pocket knives (handles only), pens, and lanyards.
6. Let all items air dry completely on a clean towel before returning them to pockets or bags.

## Why It Works

Your everyday carry items travel everywhere with you -- stores, public restrooms, offices, and vehicles. Keys accumulate hand oils and environmental grime. Wallets are handled constantly and stored in warm pockets, creating ideal conditions for bacterial growth. A study published in the journal Pathogens found that personal items like wallets and keys carry diverse bacterial communities including potential pathogens. The vinegar solution cuts through the accumulated oil film and reduces bacterial presence. Regular wiping prevents the gradual buildup that makes these items feel grimy.

## Tips

- Wipe down your EDC items once or twice per week. Making it a habit -- say, every Sunday evening -- ensures it actually happens.
- For leather wallets, use a leather-specific conditioner a few times per year to keep the material supple. Vinegar and alcohol both dry out leather.
- Metal keys can also be soaked briefly (5 minutes) in undiluted vinegar if they have visible tarnish or buildup, then scrubbed with an old toothbrush and rinsed.
- Do not forget badge lanyards and ID holders -- these sit against your neck or chest all day and absorb sweat.
- Designate a tray or hook near your entryway where EDC items land when you arrive home. Wipe the items and the tray together as a single habit.
