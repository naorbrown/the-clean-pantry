## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a heat-safe glass bowl over a small pot of simmering water. The bowl should sit above the water, not touching it.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of beeswax pellets to the bowl. Stir occasionally until fully melted (about 3 to 5 minutes).
3. Add 3 tablespoons of coconut oil and 2 tablespoons of shea butter. Stir until everything is melted and combined into a uniform liquid.
4. Remove the bowl from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
5. Let the mixture cool for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure even consistency.
6. Pour the mixture into a clean 4 oz glass jar or tin.
7. Let it cool completely at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. It will solidify into a smooth, semi-firm balm. Do not refrigerate — this can cause a grainy texture.

## Why It Works

This cream creates a moisture barrier between the baby's skin and the wet diaper environment, which is the primary mechanism for preventing and healing diaper rash. Coconut oil contains lauric acid, which has natural antimicrobial properties that help prevent bacterial and yeast infections common in the diaper area. Shea butter is rich in fatty acids and vitamins A and E, which soothe irritated skin and support healing. Beeswax provides structure to the cream and creates a breathable, water-resistant film that locks in moisture without suffocating the skin. Olive oil adds extra emollience and helps the cream spread smoothly.

## Alternative

- For a softer, more spreadable cream, increase the olive oil to 2 tablespoons and reduce the beeswax to 2 teaspoons. This makes a consistency closer to a lotion.
- Substitute mango butter for shea butter if your baby has a shea allergy. Mango butter has similar moisturizing properties and is less likely to cause reactions.
## Tips

- Apply a thin layer at every diaper change as a preventive measure, not just when a rash appears. Prevention is far more effective than treatment.
- Warm a small amount between your fingers before applying. Body heat softens the cream, making it easier to spread gently without rubbing.
- Store the jar at room temperature away from direct sunlight. This cream has no water content, so it will not grow bacteria and lasts 3 to 6 months.
- If your baby has a yeast-related diaper rash (bright red with satellite spots), see a pediatrician. This cream helps with friction-based rashes but is not antifungal.
- Clean the diaper area thoroughly with warm water and let it air-dry before applying the cream. Moisture trapped under the cream can worsen irritation.
- This cream is not compatible with cloth diapers — the oils will coat the diaper fabric and reduce absorbency. Use with disposable diapers only.
