## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler: heat-safe glass bowl over a pot of simmering water. Bowl should not touch the water.
2. Add beeswax pellets. Stir occasionally until melted, about 3-5 minutes.
3. Add coconut oil and shea butter. Stir until melted and uniform.
4. Remove from heat and stir in olive oil.
5. Cool for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Pour into a clean 4 oz glass jar or tin.
7. Cool completely at room temperature for 1-2 hours. Do not refrigerate — causes grainy texture.

## Why It Works

The cream creates a moisture barrier between skin and wet diaper. Coconut oil's lauric acid has antimicrobial properties that help prevent bacterial and yeast infections. Shea butter soothes irritated skin and supports healing. Beeswax creates a breathable, water-resistant film. Olive oil adds emollience and helps the cream spread smoothly.

## Alternative

- For a softer, more spreadable cream, increase the olive oil to 2 tablespoons and reduce the beeswax to 2 teaspoons. This makes a consistency closer to a lotion.
- Substitute mango butter for shea butter if your baby has a shea allergy. Mango butter has similar moisturizing properties and is less likely to cause reactions.
## Tips

- Apply a thin layer at every diaper change as prevention, not just when a rash appears.
- Warm a small amount between your fingers before applying for easier spreading.
- Store at room temperature away from sunlight. Lasts 3-6 months (no water content).
- For yeast-related rashes (bright red with satellite spots), see a pediatrician. This cream is not antifungal.
- Let the diaper area air-dry before applying. Trapped moisture worsens irritation.
- Not compatible with cloth diapers — oils reduce absorbency.
