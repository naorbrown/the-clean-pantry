## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup white vinegar.
3. Add 1 tsp baking soda slowly. Let the fizz settle.
4. Add 3 drops lemon essential oil if desired.
5. Cap and swirl gently.
6. When the lunchbox comes home, empty all food scraps and containers.
7. Spray the interior and inside of containers generously.
8. Let sit 1-2 minutes, then wipe clean.
9. Leave open overnight to air dry.

## Why It Works

Vinegar kills common surface bacteria including E. coli and Salmonella on contact. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic compounds that cause lingering food odors, converting them into odorless salts. Lemon oil cuts through greasy residue and adds a clean citrus scent.

## Tips

- For stubborn odors (fish, curry), sprinkle dry baking soda inside overnight, then shake out and spray.
- For insulated soft-sided lunchboxes, wipe all seams where food particles collect.
- Works on stainless steel and plastic equally well.
- Replace every 3-4 weeks.
- Teach older kids to do this themselves — it takes under a minute.
