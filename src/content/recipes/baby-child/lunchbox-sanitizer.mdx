## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda slowly -- let the fizz settle before continuing.
4. Add 3 drops of lemon essential oil if desired.
5. Cap and swirl gently to mix.
6. When your child's lunchbox comes home, empty all food scraps and containers.
7. Spray the interior of the lunchbox and the inside of any containers generously.
8. Let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then wipe clean with a cloth or paper towel.
9. Leave the lunchbox open overnight to air dry completely.

## Why It Works

Lunchboxes create a warm, enclosed environment where food residue fuels rapid bacterial growth during the school day. Vinegar's acetic acid (typically 5% concentration) kills approximately 80% of common surface bacteria on contact, including E. coli and Salmonella -- the two most relevant food safety concerns in lunch containers. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic compounds that cause lingering food odors (like the sour smell from old fruit or dairy residue) through simple acid-base reactions, converting smelly volatile acids into odorless sodium salts. Lemon essential oil contributes d-limonene, a natural solvent that cuts through greasy food residue and leaves a clean citrus scent.

## Tips

- Make this a daily habit: spray and wipe when the lunchbox comes home, leave it open to air dry overnight, and it is ready to pack in the morning.
- For stubborn odors (like fish or curry), sprinkle dry baking soda inside the closed lunchbox overnight, then shake it out and spray as usual.
- For insulated soft-sided lunchboxes, wipe the interior lining and all seams where food particles collect.
- Stainless steel and plastic containers respond equally well to this spray.
- Replace the solution every 3-4 weeks. The vinegar remains effective, but the essential oil scent fades.
- Teach older kids to do this themselves as part of their after-school routine -- it takes under a minute.
