## Steps

1. Whisk baking soda and cornstarch in a bowl until clump-free.
2. Add lemon juice and stir. It will fizz briefly.
3. Drizzle in distilled water while stirring until the paste is thick and packable, like damp sand.
4. Press firmly into a silicone muffin mold or ice cube tray, filling each cavity halfway.
5. Dry at room temperature for at least 8 hours until completely hard. A sunny windowsill speeds this up.
6. Pop out and drop one disc into the bottom of the diaper pail beneath the bag.
7. Replace every 5-7 days or when odor returns.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes both ammonia (from urine) and volatile fatty acids (from stool), converting them into odorless salts. Cornstarch binds the disc and absorbs moisture, keeping the baking soda active longer. Lemon juice neutralizes ammonia on contact and adds a clean scent.

## Tips

- Make a batch of 12 at once and store extras in an airtight jar — they keep for months.
- If your pail has a built-in deodorizer compartment, crumble a disc into it instead of placing it at the bottom.
- For an extra odor boost, add 1/4 tsp of dried lavender buds to the paste before molding.
- These also work in kitchen trash cans and diaper bags for on-the-go odor control.
