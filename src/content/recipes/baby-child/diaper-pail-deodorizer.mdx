## Steps

1. Combine the baking soda and cornstarch in a mixing bowl and whisk until no clumps remain.
2. Add the lemon juice and stir. The mixture will fizz briefly.
3. Slowly drizzle in the distilled water while stirring, adding just enough to create a thick, packable paste — similar to damp sand.
4. Firmly press the paste into a silicone muffin mold or ice cube tray, filling each cavity about halfway.
5. Let the discs dry at room temperature for at least 8 hours, or until completely hard and dry. A sunny windowsill speeds this up.
6. Pop the discs out of the mold. Drop one into the bottom of the diaper pail beneath the bag.
7. Replace the disc every 5-7 days or whenever you notice odor returning.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is amphoteric, meaning it can neutralize both acids and bases. Diaper odors are primarily caused by ammonia (a base produced when bacteria break down urea) and volatile fatty acids from stool. The baking soda reacts with both types of compounds, converting them into odorless salts. Cornstarch binds the disc together and absorbs ambient moisture, which helps the baking soda stay active longer. Lemon juice provides citric acid that also neutralizes ammonia on contact, and its clean scent offers an immediate freshness signal when you open the pail.

## Tips

- Make a batch of 12 at once and store extras in an airtight jar — they keep for months.
- If your pail has a built-in deodorizer compartment, crumble a disc into it instead of placing it at the bottom.
- For an extra odor boost, add 1/4 tsp of dried lavender buds to the paste before molding.
- These also work in kitchen trash cans and diaper bags for on-the-go odor control.
