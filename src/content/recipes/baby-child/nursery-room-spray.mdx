## Steps

1. Pour distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle (glass or BPA-free plastic).
2. Add alcohol-free witch hazel.
3. Add white vinegar.
4. Add vegetable glycerin and vanilla extract.
5. Cap and shake gently to combine.
6. Mist 2-3 sprays toward the center of the room, aiming upward.
7. Ventilate 5 minutes before placing baby in the room.

## Why It Works

Vinegar neutralizes airborne ammonia and amine compounds from diaper and spit-up odors. Witch hazel emulsifies the solution and helps it disperse as a fine mist. Glycerin increases the mist's hang time, giving the vinegar more contact with odor molecules. Pure vanilla extract provides a warm scent without respiratory irritants.

## Tips

- Shake before every use — glycerin settles.
- Vinegar scent dissipates within 2-3 minutes, leaving faint vanilla warmth.
- Store away from sunlight. Use within 3 weeks.
- Also works as a gentle closet freshener for baby clothes.
