## Steps

1. Pour the distilled water into a clean 8 oz glass or BPA-free plastic spray bottle.
2. Add the alcohol-free witch hazel. This helps the spray distribute evenly as a fine mist.
3. Add the white vinegar. This neutralizes odors rather than masking them.
4. Add the vegetable glycerin and vanilla extract.
5. Cap the bottle and shake gently to combine all ingredients.
6. To use, hold the bottle at arm's length and mist 2-3 sprays toward the center of the room, aiming upward so the mist falls gently.
7. Allow 5 minutes of ventilation before placing baby in the room.

## Why It Works

Unlike commercial air fresheners that rely on synthetic fragrance compounds and propellants, this spray works through genuine odor neutralization. The acetic acid in white vinegar binds to and neutralizes airborne ammonia and amine compounds — the molecules responsible for diaper and spit-up odors. Witch hazel acts as a natural emulsifier that keeps the solution evenly mixed and helps it disperse as a fine mist rather than heavy droplets. Vegetable glycerin slightly increases the mist's hang time in the air, giving the vinegar more contact with odor molecules. The trace amount of pure vanilla extract provides a warm, familiar scent without any of the respiratory irritants found in synthetic fragrances or essential oils.

## Tips

- Shake before every use since the glycerin tends to settle.
- The vinegar scent dissipates within 2-3 minutes, leaving behind only a faint vanilla warmth.
- Store away from direct sunlight. Use within 3 weeks since there are no preservatives.
- For diaper-change odor emergencies, spray right after the change and before tossing the diaper in the pail.
- This spray also works as a gentle closet freshener for baby clothes.
