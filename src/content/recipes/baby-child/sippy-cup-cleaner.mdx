## Steps

1. Disassemble all sippy cups and bottles completely — remove valves, straws, gaskets, and caps. These hidden parts harbor the most buildup.
2. Fill a clean basin with 1 gallon of hot (not boiling) water.
3. Add the baking soda and stir until dissolved.
4. Add the white vinegar. The mixture will foam up — this is the reaction that helps lift residue.
5. Add the hydrogen peroxide and stir once.
6. Submerge all parts in the solution, making sure valves and straws are fully covered and have no air pockets trapped inside.
7. Let everything soak for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results.
8. After soaking, use a bottle brush on the interiors. For straw tubes and valve crevices, add coarse salt and a small amount of the soaking liquid to a sealed bottle, then shake vigorously — the salt acts as an internal scrubber.

## Why It Works

Milk proteins (casein) and fats bind to plastic over time, creating a cloudy biofilm that regular dish soap struggles to penetrate. Baking soda's alkalinity breaks down casein proteins, while vinegar's acetic acid dissolves the calcium deposits left behind by hard water and formula. Hydrogen peroxide at 3% concentration is a mild oxidizer that bleaches discoloration and kills mold spores — it is the same concentration used in food-grade sanitization. The effervescent reaction between the baking soda and vinegar physically agitates liquid inside narrow straws and valve channels, reaching areas that scrubbing cannot. Coarse salt provides mechanical abrasion for the final scrub, dislodging softened residue without scratching plastic.

## Tips

- Do this deep clean weekly if your child uses bottles or sippy cups daily.
- Stainless steel bottles can also go in this soak — just skip the salt scrub to avoid scratching the interior.
- If mold persists in straw valves after soaking, replace them. Valves are inexpensive and not worth the risk.
- Clear silicone straws are easier to inspect for mold than opaque ones — choose transparent replacements when possible.
- Air dry all parts on a clean rack rather than towel drying, which can transfer lint into valve mechanisms.
