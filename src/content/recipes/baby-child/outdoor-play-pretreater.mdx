## Steps

1. Scrape off any caked-on mud or dirt with a butter knife or spoon. Let wet mud dry first -- it is easier to remove once dry. Brush off the dried chunks.
2. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda, 2 tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 teaspoon of dish soap to form a loose paste.
3. Apply the paste directly to the grass or mud stain, covering it completely.
4. Use a soft brush to work the paste gently into the fabric, scrubbing in small circles. Focus on the center of the stain where the color is most concentrated.
5. Let the paste sit on the stain for 10-15 minutes. Do not let it dry completely -- if it starts to dry, mist it lightly with water.
6. Rinse the treated area under cool running water, flushing from the back of the fabric to push the stain out rather than deeper in.
7. Check the stain. If it has faded but is not fully gone, repeat steps 3-6 one more time.
8. Launder the garment as usual in the washing machine. Do not put the item in the dryer until the stain is completely gone -- heat from the dryer will set any remaining stain permanently.

## Why It Works

Grass stains are a combination of chlorophyll, proteins, and other plant pigments that bind tightly to fabric fibers. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that breaks the chemical bonds in chlorophyll molecules responsible for the green color, converting them into colorless compounds. Baking soda provides alkalinity that helps denature the plant proteins in the stain, loosening their grip on the fabric. Dish soap contributes surfactants that emulsify the oils and waxy compounds present in grass (the cuticle layer of grass blades is waxy), allowing them to be rinsed away. Mud stains are primarily mineral particles (clay, silt) bound together with organic matter. The paste's combination of mild abrasion from baking soda, surfactant action from dish soap, and oxidizing power from peroxide addresses both the mineral and organic components.

## Tips

- Always treat stains before washing. Running a stained garment through the wash without pretreating often sets the stain with heat and agitation.
- For knee stains on jeans or play pants, apply the paste and fold the fabric over on itself so the paste is pressed into the stain. This increases contact time.
- Keep a small jar of premixed baking soda and dish soap paste in the laundry room. Add hydrogen peroxide fresh each time you use it, since peroxide breaks down over time.
- This pretreater also works well on berry stains, popsicle drips, and playground dirt marks.
- Wash the garment in cold water after pretreating. Hot water can set protein-based stain components before they are fully lifted.
