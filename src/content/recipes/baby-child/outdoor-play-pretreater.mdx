## Steps

1. Let wet mud dry first, then scrape off chunks with a butter knife.
2. Mix baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and dish soap in a small bowl to form a loose paste.
3. Apply the paste directly to the stain, covering it completely.
4. Scrub gently into the fabric with a soft brush in small circles.
5. Let sit 10-15 minutes. If it starts to dry, mist lightly with water.
6. Rinse from the back of the fabric under cool running water to push the stain out.
7. If the stain has faded but remains, repeat steps 3-6.
8. Launder as usual. Do not machine dry until the stain is completely gone — heat sets it permanently.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide breaks the bonds in chlorophyll, converting the green color into colorless compounds. Baking soda's alkalinity denatures plant proteins, loosening their grip on fabric. Dish soap emulsifies the waxy compounds in grass so they rinse away. For mud, the combination of abrasion, surfactant, and oxidizer addresses both mineral and organic components.

## Tips

- For knee stains, fold the fabric over itself to press the paste in for more contact time.
- Keep premixed baking soda and dish soap in the laundry room. Add peroxide fresh each time — it breaks down in storage.
- Also works on berry stains, popsicle drips, and playground dirt.
- Wash in cold water after pretreating. Hot water can set protein-based stains.
