## How to Make It

1. Add 2 cups of water to a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap.
4. Cap the bottle and gently swirl to combine — avoid shaking vigorously, which creates excess foam.
5. Spray onto surfaces and wipe clean with a soft cloth. No rinsing required on most surfaces, though a quick wipe with a damp cloth is fine for extra peace of mind.

## Why It Works

This formula combines the gentle grease-cutting power of castile soap with the mild disinfecting action of vinegar's acetic acid. The concentration is intentionally low — strong enough to clean food residue, drool, and everyday grime, but gentle enough that trace residue is completely harmless if a baby touches the surface afterward.

## Where to Use It

- Highchair trays and seats
- Changing table surfaces
- Crib rails (wipe with a damp cloth afterward)
- Nursery furniture and shelves
- Diaper pails (exterior)

## Important Notes

- Do **not** add essential oils. Even oils marketed as "baby-safe" can irritate infant skin and developing respiratory systems.
- The vinegar smell dissipates within minutes of application.
- This cleaner is intentionally mild. For heavy-duty messes, clean first with this spray, then follow up with a second application.
- Make a fresh batch every 1-2 weeks. Without preservatives, the diluted castile soap can lose effectiveness over time.
