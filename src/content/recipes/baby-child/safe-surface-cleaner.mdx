## Steps

1. Add 2 cups water to a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tbsp white vinegar.
3. Add 1 tsp castile soap.
4. Cap and swirl gently. Do not shake — creates excess foam.
5. Spray surfaces and wipe clean with a soft cloth.

## Why It Works

Castile soap cuts grease while vinegar's acetic acid provides mild disinfecting action. The concentration is low enough that trace residue is harmless if a baby touches the surface.

## Tips

- **Where to use it**: highchair trays, changing tables, crib rails, nursery furniture, diaper pails (exterior). Wipe crib rails with a damp cloth afterward.
- Do **not** add essential oils — they can irritate infant skin and airways.
- For heavy messes, apply twice.
- Make a fresh batch every 1-2 weeks.
