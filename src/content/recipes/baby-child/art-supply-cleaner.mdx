## Steps

1. Pour warm water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add white vinegar and swirl gently.
3. Add baking soda slowly. Wait for the fizz to settle.
4. Add castile soap and rubbing alcohol.
5. Cap and invert gently to mix. Do not shake hard.
6. Spray surfaces and let sit 30-60 seconds.
7. Wipe with a cloth, using circular motions on stubborn marks.
8. For dried glue or paint, spray and cover with a damp cloth for 2 minutes, then scrape gently with a plastic scraper.

## Why It Works

Rubbing alcohol re-dissolves alcohol-soluble marker and ink dyes on contact. Baking soda provides mild abrasion that lifts waxy crayon residue without scratching. Castile soap emulsifies dried acrylic and tempera paint into particles that wipe away. Vinegar softens dried white glue in acidic solution.

## Tips

- For washable marker on skin, a damp cloth with baking soda works faster and gentler.
- Crayon on walls responds well to this spray — test paint color in a hidden spot first.
- Soak art supply containers (paint cups, brush jars) in this solution for 10 minutes.
- Store at room temperature. Use within 4 weeks.
