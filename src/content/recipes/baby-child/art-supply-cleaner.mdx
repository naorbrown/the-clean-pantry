## Steps

1. Pour the warm water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the white vinegar and swirl gently.
3. Add the baking soda slowly — the mixture will fizz for a few seconds. Wait for it to settle.
4. Add the castile soap and rubbing alcohol.
5. Cap the bottle and invert it gently several times to mix. Do not shake hard or the soap will foam excessively.
6. Spray the art table, chairs, or supply containers and let the solution sit for 30-60 seconds.
7. Wipe with a clean cloth or sponge, using a circular motion on stubborn crayon or paint marks.
8. For dried glue or paint, apply the spray and cover with a damp cloth for 2 minutes, then peel or scrape gently with a plastic scraper.

## Why It Works

This cleaner attacks different types of art messes through complementary chemistry. Rubbing alcohol dissolves permanent marker and ink pigments because most markers use alcohol-soluble dyes — the isopropyl re-dissolves them on contact. Baking soda provides mild alkaline abrasion that lifts waxy crayon residue without scratching plastic or sealed wood tabletops. Castile soap's surfactants emulsify acrylic and tempera paint, breaking the dried paint film into small particles that wipe away. Vinegar cuts through dried white glue (PVA glue), which softens in acidic solutions. Together, these four ingredients cover the full spectrum of kid art materials in one spray.

## Tips

- For washable marker on skin, skip this spray and just use a damp cloth with baking soda — it works faster and is gentler.
- Crayon on walls responds well to this spray, but test the paint color in a hidden spot first.
- Clean art supply containers (paint cups, brush jars) by filling them with this solution and soaking for 10 minutes.
- Store at room temperature and use within 4 weeks.
- The rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly, so the surface is safe for kids within minutes of wiping.
