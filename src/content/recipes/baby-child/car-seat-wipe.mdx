## Steps

1. Combine the distilled water, white vinegar, castile soap, and vegetable glycerin in a mixing bowl and stir gently until combined.
2. Stack your cloth wipes and place them in a lidded container or large resealable bag.
3. Pour the cleaning solution evenly over the wipe stack, ensuring all cloths absorb the liquid.
4. Press down gently on the stack to help distribute the solution, then seal the container.
5. Let the wipes sit for at least 5 minutes to fully saturate.
6. To use, pull out one wipe, wring out excess liquid, and wipe down the car seat fabric, buckles, and plastic shell.
7. For stuck-on crumbs or dried milk, hold the damp wipe against the spot for 30 seconds before wiping.
8. After cleaning, leave car doors open for 10 minutes to allow the seat to air dry completely.

## Why It Works

The dilute castile soap acts as a gentle surfactant that lifts body oils, milk residue, and food smudges without damaging car seat fabrics or their flame-retardant coatings. White vinegar's acetic acid breaks down protein-based stains from milk and formula, and neutralizes the sour odor that develops when dairy spills are left in a warm car. Vegetable glycerin conditions the fabric slightly, keeping it from becoming stiff after repeated cleanings. Because the solution is water-based with no harsh solvents, it will not degrade the polycarbonate plastic shell or affect the structural integrity of the seat.

## Tips

- Keep a sealed bag of these wipes in your diaper bag or car console for on-the-go cleanups.
- Replace the batch every 2 weeks — without preservatives, bacteria can grow in stored damp cloths.
- For the harness chest clip and crotch buckle, use a dry wipe dampened with just plain water to avoid soap buildup in the mechanism.
- After wiping, a small handheld vacuum removes crumbs from crevices that cloths cannot reach.
- Wash used wipes in hot water with your regular baby laundry and reuse them for the next batch.
