## Steps

1. Combine distilled water, white vinegar, castile soap, and vegetable glycerin in a bowl. Stir gently.
2. Stack cloth wipes in a lidded container or resealable bag.
3. Pour the solution evenly over the stack.
4. Press down to distribute, then seal.
5. Let sit at least 5 minutes to saturate.
6. Pull out one wipe, wring out excess, and wipe down the car seat fabric, buckles, and plastic shell.
7. For stuck-on crumbs or dried milk, hold the wipe against the spot for 30 seconds before wiping.
8. Leave car doors open for 10 minutes to air dry.

## Why It Works

Castile soap lifts body oils, milk residue, and food smudges without damaging flame-retardant coatings. Vinegar breaks down protein-based milk and formula stains and neutralizes sour dairy odors. Vegetable glycerin conditions the fabric, preventing stiffness after repeated cleanings. No harsh solvents means no damage to the plastic shell.

## Tips

- Keep a sealed bag in your diaper bag or car console for on-the-go cleanups.
- Replace every 2 weeks — bacteria can grow in stored damp cloths.
- For harness clips and buckles, use a wipe dampened with plain water only.
- A handheld vacuum removes crumbs from crevices cloths cannot reach.
- Wash used wipes in hot water with baby laundry and reuse.
