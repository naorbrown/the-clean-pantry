## Steps

1. Pour 3/4 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of witch hazel. This helps the essential oils disperse evenly in the water.
3. Add 5 drops of tea tree oil, 8 drops of lavender oil, and 5 drops of lemon oil.
4. Cap the bottle and shake well for 10 seconds.
5. To use, shake the bottle, then spray 3-5 pumps into the center of the room, aiming upward toward the ceiling. The mist will settle through the air.
6. Spray near (but not directly at) curtains, bedding, and upholstered furniture to freshen fabrics.
7. Use daily or as needed. Open a window for a few minutes after spraying for the best combined effect.

## Why It Works

Commercial air fresheners mask odors with synthetic fragrance chemicals (many of which are phthalates used to make scents last longer) and often contain volatile organic compounds that degrade indoor air quality. This spray takes a different approach. Tea tree oil's antimicrobial terpenes actively neutralize airborne bacteria and mold spores that contribute to the musty "teen room" smell. Lemon oil's d-limonene is a natural solvent that breaks down odor molecules in the air rather than just covering them up. Lavender oil adds a clean, universally pleasant scent while contributing its own mild antibacterial properties. Witch hazel acts as an emulsifier, keeping the essential oils dispersed in the water so each spray delivers a consistent blend rather than separated oil droplets.

## Tips

- Let your teen choose their essential oil blend. Other good combinations: peppermint + eucalyptus (energizing), orange + vanilla (warm), or cedarwood + lemon (woodsy).
- The real key to a fresh-smelling teen room is ventilation. Open the window for 10 minutes daily and this spray does the rest.
- Spray a mist inside shoes, gym bags, and closets for extra freshening.
- Shake before every use -- essential oils separate from water quickly.
- Replace every 3-4 weeks. The scent fades as the essential oils oxidize over time.
- This spray is not a disinfectant. For surfaces, use a proper cleaning solution.
