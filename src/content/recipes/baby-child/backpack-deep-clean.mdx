## Steps

1. Empty the backpack completely. Check every pocket, including hidden laptop sleeves and water bottle holders. Shake out crumbs and debris.
2. Spot-treat visible stains: make a paste with 1 tablespoon of baking soda and a few drops of water. Apply the paste to stains and scrub gently with a soft brush. For ink stains, apply a small amount of vinegar directly and blot.
3. Fill a basin or bathtub with enough warm water to submerge the backpack. Add 2 tablespoons of castile soap and 1/4 cup of baking soda. Stir to dissolve.
4. Unzip all compartments and submerge the backpack. Push it down gently to release trapped air. Let it soak for 30-45 minutes.
5. After soaking, scrub the interior and exterior with the soft brush, paying attention to the bottom panel, seams, and zipper tracks where grime collects.
6. Drain the soapy water and rinse the backpack thoroughly under cool running water until no suds remain.
7. Squeeze out excess water gently -- do not wring, which can damage the fabric and straps.
8. Hang the backpack upside down outdoors or in a well-ventilated area with all zippers open. Allow it to air dry completely, which may take 12-24 hours.

## Why It Works

Over a school year, backpacks accumulate layers of hand oils, food residue, dirt, and sweat from being carried against the body. Castile soap's plant-based surfactants break down these oils and food fats by surrounding the grease molecules and lifting them into the wash water. Baking soda serves a dual purpose: its mild alkalinity helps dissolve protein-based stains (like milk, cheese, or sweat) by denaturing the proteins, and its fine crystalline structure provides gentle abrasion for scrubbing without damaging nylon or polyester fabric. The soaking step is critical because it allows the cleaning solution to penetrate tightly woven denier fabrics and reach grime trapped in the weave.

## Tips

- Do this at least twice a year: once at mid-year break and once at the end of the school year.
- For lingering odors after cleaning, stuff the dry backpack with crumpled newspaper and a few tablespoons of baking soda overnight. The newspaper absorbs moisture and the baking soda absorbs smells.
- Clean zipper tracks with an old toothbrush dipped in the soapy solution. Grime buildup is the primary reason zippers stick and break.
- If the backpack has a removable rain cover or detachable pouches, wash those separately using the same solution.
- Once fully dry, spray the exterior with a light mist of vinegar-water solution to discourage mildew if the pack will be stored for the summer.
