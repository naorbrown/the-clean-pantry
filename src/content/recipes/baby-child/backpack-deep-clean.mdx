## Steps

1. Empty the backpack completely. Check every pocket. Shake out crumbs and debris.
2. Spot-treat stains: paste 1 tbsp baking soda with a few drops of water, scrub with a soft brush. For ink, apply vinegar directly and blot.
3. Fill a basin with warm water. Add 2 tbsp castile soap and 1/4 cup baking soda. Stir to dissolve.
4. Unzip all compartments and submerge. Push down gently to release trapped air. Soak 30-45 minutes.
5. Scrub interior and exterior with the brush, focusing on the bottom panel, seams, and zipper tracks.
6. Drain and rinse under cool running water until no suds remain.
7. Squeeze out excess water gently. Do not wring.
8. Hang upside down in a ventilated area with all zippers open. Air dry 12-24 hours.

## Why It Works

Castile soap's surfactants break down hand oils, food fats, and sweat. Baking soda's alkalinity dissolves protein-based stains like milk and sweat, and its fine crystals provide gentle abrasion safe for nylon and polyester. Soaking lets the solution penetrate tightly woven fabric and reach trapped grime.

## Tips

- Do this at least twice a year: mid-year break and end of school year.
- For lingering odors, stuff the dry backpack with crumpled newspaper and baking soda overnight.
- Clean zipper tracks with an old toothbrush dipped in the soapy solution.
- Wash removable rain covers or detachable pouches separately in the same solution.
- For summer storage, spray the dry exterior with a light vinegar-water mist to discourage mildew.
