## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. Use real vanilla extract, not imitation — imitation vanilla contains synthetic compounds that may off-gas.
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Cap the bottle and shake well until the baking soda is fully dissolved.
4. To use, spray 2 to 3 mists into the air in the center of the room. Aim upward so the mist disperses and settles slowly.
5. Shake the bottle before each use, as the ingredients may separate over time.

## Why It Works

This spray works through two complementary mechanisms. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is an amphoteric compound, meaning it neutralizes both acidic and basic odor molecules rather than masking them. When dissolved in water and sprayed into the air, it reacts with odor-causing volatile compounds — the smelly molecules from dirty diapers, spit-up, and food — and converts them into odorless salts. Vanilla extract provides a warm, universally pleasant scent that is derived entirely from natural plant compounds. Unlike synthetic fragrances and essential oils, food-grade vanilla extract is recognized as safe and does not contain the concentrated volatile organic compounds that can irritate infant airways.

## Alternative

- For a completely unscented option, omit the vanilla extract and use only baking soda and distilled water. The spray will still neutralize odors effectively, just without a pleasant scent.
- A shallow dish of baking soda placed on a high shelf (safely out of reach) works as a passive odor absorber. Replace it every 2 weeks.
## Tips

- Use distilled water to prevent mineral buildup in the spray nozzle and to extend the shelf life of the spray. Tap water can introduce bacteria.
- This spray lasts about 2 weeks at room temperature. Make small batches to keep it fresh. If it develops an off smell, discard and make a new batch.
- Never spray this directly onto crib bedding, stuffed animals, or any surface a baby might mouth. It is designed as an air spray only.
- For diaper pail odors specifically, sprinkle dry baking soda into the bottom of the pail under the liner. This addresses the odor at the source and works around the clock.
- The vanilla scent is subtle by design. If you find it too faint, increase the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons — but no more, as excessive amounts can leave a sticky residue when the mist settles.
- Keep the bottle out of direct sunlight, which can degrade the vanilla and cause discoloration.
