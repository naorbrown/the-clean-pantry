## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tsp pure vanilla extract (not imitation).
3. Add 1/2 tsp baking soda. Cap and shake until dissolved.
4. Spray 2-3 mists into the air, aiming upward so the mist settles slowly.
5. Shake before each use.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes both acidic and basic odor molecules, converting them into odorless salts. Vanilla extract provides a warm, pleasant scent from natural plant compounds without the concentrated volatiles that can irritate infant airways.

## Alternative

- For a completely unscented option, omit the vanilla extract and use only baking soda and distilled water. The spray will still neutralize odors effectively, just without a pleasant scent.
- A shallow dish of baking soda placed on a high shelf (safely out of reach) works as a passive odor absorber. Replace it every 2 weeks.
## Tips

- Lasts about 2 weeks. Make small batches. Discard if it develops an off smell.
- Air spray only — never spray onto crib bedding or surfaces baby might mouth.
- For diaper pail odors, sprinkle dry baking soda under the liner instead.
- If the vanilla scent is too faint, increase to 2 tsp — but no more, or it leaves sticky residue.
- Keep out of direct sunlight.
