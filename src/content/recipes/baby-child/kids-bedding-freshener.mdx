## Steps

1. Pour 3/4 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Cap and shake until the baking soda dissolves.
3. Add 8 drops of lavender essential oil. Shake well.
4. Strip the sheets and pillowcases from the bed.
5. Lightly mist the mattress surface, focusing on the area where the child sleeps. Hold the bottle 12-18 inches from the surface.
6. Let the mattress air for 15-30 minutes while you wash the sheets.
7. For pillows, mist lightly and fluff them by hand to distribute the spray into the filling.
8. Once the mattress is dry to the touch, make the bed with fresh sheets.
9. Spray a light mist over the made bed as a finishing touch. Shake the bottle before each use as the baking soda may settle.

## Why It Works

Children sweat during sleep, and that moisture plus shed skin cells creates a breeding ground for dust mites and odor-causing bacteria in mattresses and pillows. Baking soda is hygroscopic -- it absorbs moisture from the mattress surface and with it the volatile organic compounds responsible for stale sleeping odors. When dissolved in water and sprayed, it creates a mildly alkaline mist (pH around 8.3) that neutralizes acidic sweat compounds on contact. Lavender essential oil contains linalool and linalyl acetate, which have been shown in studies to have mild antimicrobial properties and a calming effect. The light mist evaporates quickly, leaving behind a thin residue of baking soda crystals that continue to absorb odors between sheet changes.

## Tips

- Use this spray every time you change the sheets -- weekly is ideal for kids' beds.
- For a deeper mattress refresh, sprinkle dry baking soda directly on the bare mattress, let it sit for 30 minutes, then vacuum it up before spraying.
- If your child does not like lavender, substitute with chamomile essential oil (same number of drops) for a similarly calming scent.
- This spray also works well on stuffed animals. Mist lightly and let them air dry on a towel.
- Shake well before every use -- the baking soda settles quickly.
- Replace the solution every 2-3 weeks since there are no preservatives.
