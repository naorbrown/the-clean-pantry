## Steps

1. Pour 3/4 cup distilled water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tbsp baking soda. Cap and shake until dissolved.
3. Add 8 drops lavender essential oil. Shake well.
4. Strip sheets and pillowcases.
5. Lightly mist the mattress, focusing on the sleep area. Hold 12-18 inches away.
6. Let air for 15-30 minutes while you wash the sheets.
7. Mist pillows lightly and fluff by hand to distribute the spray.
8. Once dry to the touch, make the bed with fresh sheets.
9. Spray a light finishing mist over the made bed. Shake before each use.

## Why It Works

Baking soda absorbs moisture and the volatile compounds responsible for stale odors. Its mildly alkaline mist neutralizes acidic sweat compounds on contact. Lavender oil has mild antimicrobial properties and a calming effect. The mist evaporates quickly, leaving baking soda crystals that continue absorbing odors between sheet changes.

## Tips

- Use every time you change sheets — weekly is ideal.
- For a deeper refresh, sprinkle dry baking soda on the bare mattress, wait 30 minutes, then vacuum before spraying.
- Substitute chamomile oil (same drops) if your child dislikes lavender.
- Also works on stuffed animals. Mist lightly and air dry on a towel.
- Replace every 2-3 weeks — no preservatives.
