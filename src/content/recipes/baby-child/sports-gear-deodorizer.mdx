## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda slowly -- the mixture will fizz briefly. Wait for the fizzing to stop.
4. Add 10 drops of tea tree oil and 5 drops of lavender oil.
5. Cap and swirl gently to combine.
6. After practice or a game, open the gear up to air out. Remove insoles from cleats if possible.
7. Spray the inside of cleats, helmets, shin guards, and pads liberally. Spray the inside of gym bags as well.
8. Let everything air dry in a well-ventilated area for at least 2 hours before storing.

## Why It Works

Sports equipment odor comes from bacteria (primarily Brevibacterium and Staphylococcus species) that feed on sweat trapped in foam padding, mesh linings, and shoe insoles. Vinegar's acetic acid lowers the pH of these surfaces below the range where odor-causing bacteria can thrive, effectively killing them on contact. Baking soda neutralizes the volatile fatty acids (like isovaleric acid) that produce the characteristic sour smell. Tea tree oil adds sustained antimicrobial action -- its terpinen-4-ol disrupts bacterial cell membranes, providing a residual antibacterial effect even after the spray has dried. Together, these three ingredients break the cycle of bacterial growth, acid production, and odor accumulation.

## Tips

- Spray gear immediately after use for the best results. The longer sweat sits, the more bacteria multiply.
- For helmets with removable padding, pull the pads out and spray both sides.
- Stuff newspaper loosely inside cleats after spraying to absorb excess moisture and speed drying.
- For extremely smelly gear, place items in a sealed plastic bag with 1/2 cup of baking soda overnight, then spray and air dry the next day.
- Store this spray in your car's trunk or the mudroom so it is always accessible right after practice.
- Use within 4-6 weeks for best results.
