## Steps

1. Pour the distilled water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the white vinegar and swirl gently to combine.
3. Add the liquid castile soap. Tip the bottle slowly to avoid creating excess foam.
4. Add the baking soda. It will fizz briefly as it reacts with the vinegar — this is normal and will settle in a few seconds.
5. Cap the bottle and gently invert it a few times to mix. Do not shake vigorously.
6. To use, spray the high chair seat, straps, and tray liberally. Let the solution sit for 1-2 minutes on stubborn dried food.
7. Wipe everything down with a clean, damp microfiber cloth.
8. Follow with a plain water wipe on the tray and any surface baby's mouth may contact.

## Why It Works

White vinegar's acetic acid dissolves the proteins and starches in dried baby food, loosening crusted-on purees that otherwise require heavy scrubbing. Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant that lifts grease and oils — particularly useful for meals containing avocado, nut butters, or cheese. Baking soda provides gentle abrasion at a microscopic level and also neutralizes odors from sour milk or fermented food residue trapped in seams. Because all three ingredients are food-grade at these concentrations, the cleaner is safe to use on eating surfaces as long as you do a final plain-water wipe.

## Tips

- For dried-on food that has been sitting for hours, spray and lay a damp cloth over the area for 5 minutes before wiping. The moisture softens the residue dramatically.
- Clean harness straps weekly by removing them (if your model allows) and soaking in this solution for 10 minutes, then air drying.
- Store at room temperature. The solution keeps for about 4 weeks.
- This cleaner also works well on booster seats and portable travel high chairs.
