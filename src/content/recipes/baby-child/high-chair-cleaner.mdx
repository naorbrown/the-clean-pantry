## Steps

1. Pour distilled water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add white vinegar and swirl gently.
3. Add castile soap. Tip the bottle slowly to avoid excess foam.
4. Add baking soda. Let the brief fizz settle.
5. Cap and invert gently to mix. Do not shake.
6. Spray the seat, straps, and tray. Let sit 1-2 minutes on dried food.
7. Wipe with a damp microfiber cloth.
8. Follow with a plain water wipe on the tray and any surface baby's mouth contacts.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves proteins and starches in dried baby food, loosening crusted-on purees. Castile soap lifts grease from avocado, nut butters, and cheese. Baking soda provides gentle abrasion and neutralizes sour milk odors trapped in seams. All three ingredients are food-grade at these concentrations.

## Tips

- For hours-old dried food, spray and lay a damp cloth over the area for 5 minutes before wiping.
- Clean harness straps weekly by removing them and soaking in this solution for 10 minutes, then air drying.
- Store at room temperature. Use within 4 weeks.
- Also works on booster seats and portable travel high chairs.
