## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of warm water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda slowly -- let the fizzing subside before continuing.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of castile soap. Cap and invert gently to mix.
5. For everyday messes, spray the craft table surface and wipe with a damp cloth.
6. For dried marker stains, spray generously and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Scrub with a soft cloth in circular motions.
7. For dried paint, spray and cover the area with a damp cloth for 5 minutes to soften the paint. Scrape gently with a plastic scraper or old credit card, then wipe clean.
8. For dried glue (white school glue or glue stick residue), spray and let sit for 3-5 minutes. The glue will soften and peel or wipe away.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves white glue and glue stick residue by breaking the polymer chains. Baking soda provides mild abrasion that lifts crayon marks without scratching sealed surfaces. Castile soap emulsifies dried acrylic and tempera paint into particles that wipe away. The vinegar-soap combination dissolves washable marker dyes and helps lift permanent marker.

## Tips

- Permanent markers may need 2-3 applications. For stubborn marks, scrub with a baking soda paste.
- Works on plastic organizers, painting easels, and laminate tabletops.
- Clean messes the same day. Fresh messes lift in seconds; dried paint takes much more effort.
- Store at room temperature. Use within 4 weeks.
- The art supply cleaner recipe on this site adds rubbing alcohol for tougher permanent marker stains.
