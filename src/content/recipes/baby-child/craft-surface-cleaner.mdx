## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of warm water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda slowly -- let the fizzing subside before continuing.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of castile soap. Cap and invert gently to mix.
5. For everyday messes, spray the craft table surface and wipe with a damp cloth.
6. For dried marker stains, spray generously and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Scrub with a soft cloth in circular motions.
7. For dried paint, spray and cover the area with a damp cloth for 5 minutes to soften the paint. Scrape gently with a plastic scraper or old credit card, then wipe clean.
8. For dried glue (white school glue or glue stick residue), spray and let sit for 3-5 minutes. The glue will soften and peel or wipe away.

## Why It Works

Different craft messes require different chemistry, and this cleaner covers the main ones. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves PVA-based white glue and glue stick residue by breaking the polymer chains. Baking soda provides mild alkaline abrasion that lifts waxy crayon marks and pigment particles without scratching sealed surfaces. Castile soap contributes surfactants that emulsify dried acrylic and tempera paint, breaking the paint film into particles that suspend in water and wipe away. For markers, the combination of vinegar and soap dissolves both the water-soluble dyes in washable markers and helps lift some of the alcohol-soluble dyes in permanent markers.

## Tips

- Washable markers come off with just the spray and a wipe. Permanent markers may need 2-3 applications and some extra scrubbing.
- For stubborn permanent marker, apply a small amount of baking soda paste (baking soda mixed with a few drops of water) directly to the mark and scrub with a cloth.
- This cleaner works well on plastic craft organizers, painting easels, and laminate tabletops.
- Clean up craft messes the same day if possible. Fresh messes come off in seconds; week-old dried paint takes much more effort.
- Store at room temperature. Use within 4 weeks.
- The art supply cleaner recipe on this site adds rubbing alcohol for tougher permanent marker stains if this version is not strong enough.
