## How to Make It

1. Fill a clean basin or sink with 1 gallon of warm water.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar and stir briefly to combine.
3. Submerge toys in the solution and let them soak for 10-15 minutes.
4. For toys with crevices, use a clean toothbrush to gently scrub any buildup.
5. Rinse every toy thoroughly under clean running water.
6. For bath toys with holes, squeeze them several times under running water to flush out the interior.
7. Air dry completely on a clean towel before returning toys to the play area.

## Why It Works

The mild acetic acid in vinegar cuts through grime, saliva residue, and light bacterial buildup without leaving behind any harmful chemical residue. At this dilution, the solution is strong enough to clean effectively but gentle enough that any trace residue remaining after rinsing is completely food-safe — important for toys that inevitably end up in little mouths.

## Tips

- Clean toys weekly, or immediately after illness.
- For bath toys that have developed mold inside (visible black spots when squeezed), it is best to discard them. Seal the holes of new bath toys with a dab of hot glue to prevent water from getting trapped inside.
- Stuffed animals and fabric toys cannot be soaked — toss them in the washing machine on a gentle cycle instead.

## What Not to Soak

- **Wooden toys**: Water causes swelling and cracking. Wipe wooden toys with a damp cloth instead.
- **Battery-operated toys**: Remove batteries and wipe the exterior only. Do not submerge.
- **Toys with paper stickers or labels**: The soak will loosen adhesive and damage labels.
