## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of distilled water into a clean 8 oz pump bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap.
3. Add 3 drops of tea tree essential oil and 2 drops of lavender essential oil.
4. Cap the bottle and swirl gently to combine. Do not shake vigorously or it will foam up.
5. To use, pump 1-2 pumps into wet hands, lather gently, and massage onto damp face in circular motions for 20-30 seconds.
6. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat dry with a clean towel.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is made from plant oils (typically olive, coconut, and hemp) that produce a mild surfactant capable of dissolving excess sebum without stripping the skin's acid mantle -- the thin protective layer that keeps teenage skin balanced. When the acid mantle is disrupted by harsh cleansers, the skin overcompensates by producing even more oil, which worsens breakouts. Tea tree oil contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound with well-documented antimicrobial properties that targets Cutibacterium acnes, the bacterium most commonly associated with adolescent acne. At the low concentration used here (roughly 0.15%), it provides antibacterial benefits without the drying or irritation that benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products often cause on young skin.

## Tips

- Use lukewarm water, not hot. Hot water strips oils faster and triggers rebound oil production.
- This face wash is gentle enough for twice-daily use (morning and evening), but once a day is fine for dry or sensitive skin.
- If your teen has very oily skin, increase the castile soap to 3 tablespoons. If their skin feels tight after washing, reduce to 1 tablespoon.
- Store at room temperature away from direct sunlight. Use within 3-4 weeks since there are no preservatives.
- Shake gently before each use as the oils and water may separate.
