## Steps

1. If your coconut oil is solid, melt it by placing the jar in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes or microwaving in 10-second bursts until just liquid. Let it cool until warm but not hot.
2. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of melted coconut oil. Stir until every grain of sugar is coated.
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vitamin E oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract if using. Stir to combine.
4. If using lemon essential oil, add 5 drops and mix thoroughly.
5. Transfer the scrub into a clean 8 oz mason jar or container with a tight-fitting lid.
6. To use, scoop out a palmful in the shower, massage onto damp skin in circular motions for 30-60 seconds per area, then rinse with warm water.

## Why It Works

Sugar is a natural source of glycolic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that dissolves the protein bonds holding dead skin cells together. Unlike salt scrubs, sugar granules have rounded edges that exfoliate mechanically without creating micro-tears in the skin. As the sugar dissolves during use, it transitions from a scrub to a chemical exfoliant, providing a dual-action effect. Coconut oil is rich in medium-chain fatty acids, particularly lauric acid, which has antimicrobial properties and penetrates the skin more effectively than many plant oils due to its small molecular size. The oil also creates a moisture-sealing layer that prevents transepidermal water loss after exfoliation, which is when the skin is most vulnerable to drying out.

## Tips

- Use 1-2 times per week. Over-exfoliation strips the skin's protective lipid barrier and leads to irritation, not smoother skin.
- For a finer scrub, use superfine sugar. For a more intense exfoliation on rough areas like elbows and heels, use raw turbinado sugar.
- The coconut oil may solidify in cooler temperatures, making the scrub firm. This is normal -- it softens quickly in the warmth of the shower.
- Store at room temperature away from direct sunlight. The scrub keeps for 2-3 months since sugar and coconut oil resist bacterial growth.
