## Steps

1. Pour 1 tablespoon of jojoba oil into a small glass bowl or directly into a 1/2 oz roller bottle using a tiny funnel.
2. Add 1 teaspoon of sweet almond oil and 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil.
3. Add 3 drops of lavender essential oil and 2 drops of lemon essential oil if using.
4. If using a roller bottle, secure the rollerball and cap, then roll between your palms for 30 seconds to blend. If mixing in a bowl, stir gently and transfer to your roller bottle or small dropper bottle.
5. To apply, roll or drop a small amount onto each cuticle and nail bed. Massage gently into the cuticle and surrounding skin for 20-30 seconds per nail.
6. Use daily before bed for best results, or any time cuticles feel dry or tight.

## Why It Works

Jojoba oil is technically a liquid wax ester, not an oil, and its molecular structure closely mimics human sebum. This means the skin around the nails absorbs it readily without a greasy residue. It creates a thin breathable barrier that prevents transepidermal water loss from the cuticle area. Sweet almond oil is rich in oleic and linoleic fatty acids that soften and condition hardened cuticle tissue, making it less likely to crack or peel. Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals in the nail matrix -- the tissue under the cuticle where new nail cells are generated. Healthier matrix cells produce stronger, smoother nail plates. Lavender oil provides mild antiseptic protection against the bacteria that can enter through hangnails and torn cuticles.

## Tips

- Apply after washing hands, when cuticles are most vulnerable to drying out. Soap strips natural oils from the skin, and the cuticle area loses moisture faster than other parts of the hand.
- A roller bottle is ideal for cuticle oil because it applies a controlled amount without mess. Look for 10 ml glass roller bottles online.
- This oil keeps for 4-6 months at room temperature thanks to vitamin E acting as a natural antioxidant. Store away from direct sunlight.
- Never cut your cuticles. Instead, soften them with this oil and gently push them back with an orange stick. Cutting creates entry points for infection.
