## Steps

1. In a small bowl, measure 1/4 cup of arrowroot powder.
2. If you have dark brown or black hair, add 1-2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and mix thoroughly. For medium brown hair, use 1 tablespoon. For light or blonde hair, skip the cocoa entirely.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda and stir to combine evenly.
4. If using essential oils, add 5 drops of lavender and 3 drops of tea tree. Stir vigorously to distribute the oils throughout the powder, breaking up any small clumps.
5. Transfer the mixture into a clean shaker jar, salt shaker, or repurposed spice container with a lid. A large makeup brush or powder puff works well for application too.
6. To use, sprinkle a small amount onto your roots or along your part line. Let it sit for 2 minutes, then massage into your scalp with your fingertips and brush through with a natural bristle brush.

## Why It Works

Arrowroot powder is a fine starch extracted from the Maranta arundinacea plant. Its particles are extremely small and absorbent -- each grain can hold several times its weight in moisture and oil. When applied to oily roots, arrowroot starches absorb sebum through capillary action, wicking oil away from the hair shaft and leaving hair looking clean and voluminous. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) contributes additional oil absorption and raises the pH at the scalp slightly, which slows sebum production temporarily. Cocoa powder serves a dual purpose: it tints the dry shampoo to blend seamlessly with dark hair (preventing white residue) and its natural tannins have mild astringent properties that further reduce oiliness. Tea tree oil provides antifungal properties that help maintain a healthy scalp microbiome between washes.

## Tips

- Apply dry shampoo the night before you need it rather than the morning of. The powder has more time to absorb oil overnight, and brushing it through in the morning gives the most natural-looking results.
- Start with a small amount and add more if needed. Too much powder creates a dull, matte appearance that is difficult to brush out.
- For redheads, replace cocoa powder with equal parts cinnamon. Test on a small section first to ensure the color matches.
- This dry shampoo keeps for 6 months or more in an airtight container since it contains no water and bacteria cannot grow in dry powder.
