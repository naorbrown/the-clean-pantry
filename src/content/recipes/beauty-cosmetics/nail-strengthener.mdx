## Steps

1. Finely mince 2 cloves of fresh garlic. Let the minced garlic rest for 5 minutes -- this activates the beneficial sulfur compounds through enzyme action.
2. In a shallow bowl wide enough to fit your fingertips, combine 1/2 cup of warm water with 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil. Stir gently to create a loose emulsion.
4. Add the minced garlic to the bowl and stir to distribute.
5. Submerge your fingertips in the mixture, ensuring all nails are covered. Soak for 10-15 minutes.
6. Remove your fingers and rinse with lukewarm water. Pat dry and apply a moisturizer or cuticle oil to the nail area.

## Why It Works

Garlic contains allicin, a sulfur compound that forms when garlic cells are crushed. Sulfur is a key building block of keratin, the protein that makes up fingernails. Soaking nails in an allicin-rich solution delivers bioavailable sulfur directly to the nail plate, reinforcing cross-links between keratin fibers and increasing nail hardness. Lemon juice provides citric acid, which etches away the damaged outermost layer of the nail surface, allowing the strengthening compounds to penetrate deeper. The acidic environment also helps seal the layered structure of the nail plate, reducing peeling. Olive oil prevents the soak from being overly drying by coating the nail and cuticle with oleic acid, a fatty acid that the skin absorbs readily. Vitamin E protects the nail matrix from oxidative damage that can weaken new nail growth.

## Tips

- Use this soak 2-3 times per week for 4-6 weeks to see noticeable results. Nail growth is slow -- about 3 mm per month -- so improvement happens gradually.
- The garlic smell on your fingers will fade within a few hours. Washing your hands with a paste of baking soda and lemon juice speeds up the process.
- Always let minced garlic rest before adding it to the soak. Crushing garlic starts an enzymatic reaction that produces allicin, but it takes about 5 minutes to reach peak concentration.
- For toenails, double the recipe amounts and use a basin large enough for your feet.
