## Steps

1. Brew a cup of green tea using 1 tea bag or 1 teaspoon of loose leaf in 1/2 cup of boiling water. Steep for 5 minutes, then let it cool completely to room temperature. You will only need 1/4 cup.
2. In a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle, combine 1/4 cup of cooled green tea with 2 tablespoons of rose water.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of pure aloe vera gel and 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. The aloe vera may clump initially.
4. If using, add 2 thin cucumber slices directly into the bottle.
5. Secure the spray nozzle and shake vigorously for 20-30 seconds until the aloe vera is fully dissolved and the mixture is uniform.
6. To use, hold the bottle 6-8 inches from your face, close your eyes, and mist lightly. Use over bare skin, over makeup, or any time your skin feels tight or dry during the day.

## Why It Works

Aloe vera gel contains polysaccharides -- long sugar chains -- that form an invisible breathable film on the skin surface. This film slows transepidermal water loss without clogging pores, keeping skin hydrated throughout the day. Green tea is rich in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the most potent natural antioxidants, which neutralizes free radicals from UV exposure and pollution that accelerate skin aging. Rose water provides gentle anti-inflammatory benefits and its pH of approximately 5.5 matches healthy skin pH, so the mist does not disrupt the acid mantle. Vegetable glycerin is a humectant that actively draws moisture from the air into the skin's outer layer, making this mist effective even in dry indoor environments where humidity is low.

## Tips

- Shake before every use. The aloe vera and glycerin settle to the bottom over time.
- Store in the refrigerator for an extra-refreshing cooling effect. The cold mist feels especially good on hot days or after a workout.
- This mist works beautifully as a makeup setting spray. Mist lightly over finished makeup to blend powders and reduce cakiness.
- If the mist clogs, the aloe vera gel may not have been fully dissolved. Remove the nozzle, shake thoroughly, and test again. Strain through a fine mesh strainer if clumps persist.
