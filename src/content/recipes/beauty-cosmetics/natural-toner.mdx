## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of pure rose water into a clean 4 oz glass spray bottle or bottle with a flip-top cap.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin and 1 teaspoon of pure aloe vera gel.
4. Drop in 3 drops of vitamin E oil.
5. Secure the cap and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds until the mixture is fully blended.
6. To use, apply a small amount to a cotton pad and gently sweep across your face and neck after cleansing and before moisturizing. Alternatively, mist directly onto your face if using a spray bottle.

## Why It Works

Witch hazel contains hamamelitannin, a polyphenol with astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. It tightens pores temporarily by constricting skin tissue and reduces redness. Unlike alcohol-based toners that strip the skin's acid mantle, alcohol-free witch hazel preserves the skin's natural protective barrier while still removing residual cleanser and oil. Rose water has a pH of approximately 5.5, which closely matches healthy skin pH, helping to restore balance after washing with alkaline soap or cleanser. Vegetable glycerin is a humectant that pulls moisture from the air into the outer layer of the skin, preventing the tight dry feeling that many toners cause. Aloe vera provides polysaccharides that form a breathable moisture barrier, keeping the hydration locked in.

## Tips

- Store in the refrigerator for a cooling, pore-tightening effect when applied. The cold temperature enhances the astringent action of the witch hazel.
- Shake before every use. The glycerin and aloe vera will naturally separate from the water-based ingredients over time.
- This toner has no synthetic preservatives and should be used within 3-4 weeks. Refrigeration extends its shelf life to about 6 weeks.
- For oily skin, increase the witch hazel to 3 tablespoons and reduce the glycerin to 1/2 teaspoon.
