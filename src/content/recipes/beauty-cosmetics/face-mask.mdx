## Steps

1. Grind 1 tablespoon of rolled oats in a blender or food processor until you have a fine powder (colloidal oatmeal). A few coarser pieces are fine.
2. In a small bowl, combine the ground oats, 1 tablespoon of raw honey, and 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt. Stir until smooth.
3. If using, add 1/2 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice and stir to combine.
4. Wash your face with warm water and pat dry.
5. Apply the mask in a thin, even layer over your face, avoiding the eye area and lips.
6. Relax for 15-20 minutes while the mask dries. It will feel slightly tight as it sets.
7. Rinse off with lukewarm water, using gentle circular motions to lightly exfoliate with the oat particles as you remove the mask.
8. Pat dry and follow with your usual moisturizer.

## Why It Works

Colloidal oatmeal (finely ground oats) contains avenanthramides, which are anti-inflammatory compounds that calm redness and irritation. The FDA recognizes colloidal oatmeal as a skin protectant. Raw honey draws moisture into the skin as a humectant while its natural enzyme activity gently dissolves dead skin cells. Yogurt contains lactic acid, a mild alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that dissolves the bonds holding dead skin cells together, promoting gentle exfoliation without harsh scrubbing. The optional lemon juice adds vitamin C and additional citric acid for a mild brightening effect.

## Alternative

- For dry skin, add 1 teaspoon of mashed avocado to the mixture. The healthy fats in avocado deeply nourish dehydrated skin.
- For oily or acne-prone skin, replace the yogurt with 1 tablespoon of bentonite clay mixed with 1 tablespoon of water. The clay absorbs excess oil from pores.
- For a vegan version, replace honey with mashed banana (1 tablespoon) and yogurt with coconut cream.

## Tips

- Use this mask 1-2 times per week. More frequent use may over-exfoliate and irritate the skin.
- Make only what you need for a single application. This mask contains fresh dairy and has no preservatives, so it cannot be stored.
- The lemon juice makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight. If you use the lemon juice version, apply sunscreen before going outside.
- Full-fat yogurt works better than low-fat because the fat content helps the mask adhere to the skin and provides additional moisturization.
