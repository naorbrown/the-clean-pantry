## Steps

1. If the coconut oil is solid, warm it gently in a small saucepan over low heat or in the microwave for 15-20 seconds until just melted. Do not overheat.
2. Mash half a ripe avocado in a bowl until completely smooth with no lumps. A fork works well, but a blender produces the smoothest result.
3. Add 3 tablespoons of melted coconut oil, 1 tablespoon of raw honey, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the mashed avocado. Mix until you have a uniform, creamy paste.
4. If using, stir in 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.
5. Apply the mask to dry or damp hair, starting at the mid-lengths and working down to the ends. Avoid the roots and scalp unless your scalp is very dry.
6. Pile your hair on top of your head and cover with a shower cap or plastic wrap. For deeper penetration, wrap a warm towel over the cap.
7. Leave the mask on for 30-45 minutes.
8. Rinse with warm water, then shampoo twice to fully remove the oils. Follow with your regular conditioner if desired.

## Why It Works

Coconut oil is one of the only oils scientifically shown to penetrate the hair shaft rather than simply coating it. Its primary fatty acid, lauric acid, has a high affinity for hair proteins and a small enough molecular structure to pass through the cuticle into the cortex, where it reduces protein loss during washing by up to 39%. Avocado provides vitamins B and E along with monounsaturated oleic acid, which softens and strengthens hair from the outside. Raw honey is a humectant that attracts and retains moisture in the hair fiber, preventing the brittleness that leads to split ends. Olive oil coats the outer cuticle with a thin lipid film that reflects light and gives the appearance of shine. The optional apple cider vinegar smooths the cuticle scale further, amplifying the light-reflecting effect.

## Tips

- Use this mask once a week for damaged hair, or once every two weeks for maintenance on healthy hair. More frequent use can lead to protein overload and stiff, straw-like hair.
- The warm towel trick works because heat opens the hair cuticle, allowing the oils to penetrate deeper into the cortex. A blow dryer on low heat over the shower cap achieves the same effect.
- If you have fine hair, use only 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and skip the olive oil. Fine hair is easily weighed down by heavy oils.
- Always shampoo twice after removing the mask. The first wash breaks up the oil, and the second actually removes it.
