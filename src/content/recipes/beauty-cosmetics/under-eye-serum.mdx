## Steps

1. Combine 2 tablespoons of jojoba oil and 1 teaspoon of finely ground coffee in a small heat-safe glass jar.
2. Create a double boiler by placing the jar in a small saucepan with 1 inch of simmering water. Heat on low for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This infuses the oil with caffeine.
3. Remove the jar from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes.
4. Strain the oil through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl. Squeeze the cheesecloth to extract every drop of infused oil. Discard the grounds.
5. Add 1 teaspoon of rosehip seed oil, 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil, and 2 drops of lavender essential oil if using. Stir to combine.
6. Transfer the finished serum into a clean 1/2 oz glass dropper bottle using a small funnel.
7. To use, apply 1-2 drops to your ring finger and gently pat along the orbital bone under each eye. Use morning and evening.

## Why It Works

Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor -- it temporarily narrows blood vessels. When applied topically to the thin skin under the eyes, caffeine reduces blood flow to the area, diminishing the dark bluish-purple appearance caused by visible blood vessels beneath the surface. Caffeine also inhibits phosphodiesterase, an enzyme involved in fat storage, which can help reduce the fluid retention that causes puffiness. Jojoba oil serves as the carrier because its molecular weight is light enough for the delicate under-eye area without clogging pores. Rosehip seed oil is rich in trans-retinoic acid, a natural form of vitamin A that stimulates collagen production in the thin under-eye skin, improving firmness over time. Vitamin E provides antioxidant protection against UV-induced free radical damage, a primary cause of premature aging around the eyes.

## Tips

- Store the serum in a dark glass bottle and keep it in the refrigerator. The cold temperature adds an additional de-puffing effect, and refrigeration extends shelf life to 6-8 weeks.
- Use your ring finger to apply -- it naturally applies the least pressure of all fingers, which is important for the delicate under-eye area.
- For faster results, store the serum in the fridge and apply chilled in the morning. Cold further constricts blood vessels and reduces morning puffiness.
- This serum will not eliminate dark circles caused by genetics or deep-set bone structure, but it visibly reduces circles caused by fatigue, allergies, and fluid retention.
