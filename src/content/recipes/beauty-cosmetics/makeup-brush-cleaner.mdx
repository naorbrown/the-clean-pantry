## Steps

1. Place 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap and 1 teaspoon of olive oil on a small plate or in a shallow bowl. Swirl them together with your finger until lightly combined.
2. Wet the brush bristles under lukewarm running water, pointing the bristles downward so water does not run into the ferrule (the metal band where the bristles meet the handle).
3. Gently swirl the wet brush in the soap-oil mixture on the plate, working the solution into the bristles with circular motions.
4. Rinse the brush under lukewarm running water, continuing to gently squeeze and massage the bristles until the water runs clear and no soap residue remains.
5. For heavily soiled brushes, repeat steps 3-4 a second time.
6. Gently squeeze excess water from the bristles with a clean towel.
7. Reshape the bristles with your fingers and lay the brushes flat on a towel with the bristles hanging slightly off the counter edge, angled downward. This prevents water from pooling in the ferrule.
8. Allow to air dry completely before using, typically 4-8 hours depending on brush density.

## Why It Works

Makeup brushes accumulate layers of pigment, oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria with each use. Castile soap's surfactants break down and emulsify these residues, lifting them out of the bristles and into the rinse water. The small amount of olive oil is critical for removing stubborn products like waterproof foundation and long-wear concealer -- oil dissolves oil-based cosmetics far more effectively than soap and water alone. This is the same principle behind oil cleansing for skin. The combination of soap and oil cleans the brush thoroughly without stripping or drying out natural-hair bristles.

## Alternative

- Replace olive oil with fractionated coconut oil for a lighter option that rinses out faster and leaves no residual scent.
- For a quick spot-clean between washes, spray a mixture of 1 part white vinegar and 2 parts water onto a paper towel and swirl the brush on it. This removes surface pigment and disinfects but is not a substitute for a full wash.
- For synthetic brushes that handle rougher treatment, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the soap mixture for extra scrubbing power.

## Tips

- Clean your brushes at least every 1-2 weeks. Foundation and concealer brushes collect the most bacteria and should be washed weekly. Powder brushes can go 2 weeks.
- Never stand brushes upright to dry with bristles pointing up. Water drains into the ferrule, dissolves the glue, and causes bristle shedding over time.
- Use lukewarm water only. Hot water can melt the glue in the ferrule and damage natural hair bristles. Cold water will not dissolve makeup effectively.
- If a brush smells musty even after washing, it likely has mildew inside the ferrule from improper drying. Replace it.
- For textured silicone brush cleaning mats, the soap-oil mixture works exactly the same way. Swirl the brush on the mat in the mixture for deeper cleaning.
