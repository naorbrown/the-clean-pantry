## Steps

1. Turn off the circuit breaker. Confirm outlets are not live with a voltage tester.
2. Unscrew and remove cover plates. Place screws in a small dish.
3. Fill a basin with 2 cups warm water, 1 tsp dish soap, and 1 cup hydrogen peroxide.
4. Submerge covers and soak 20-30 minutes.
5. Scrub each cover with an old toothbrush, focusing on edges and textured areas.
6. For yellowed covers, apply a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide. Let sit 10 minutes, then scrub.
7. Rinse under clean water and dry thoroughly.
8. Reinstall when completely dry. Tighten snugly but do not over-torque. Turn the breaker back on.

## Why It Works

Covers yellow because flame retardants in the plastic react with UV light. Hydrogen peroxide reverses this by breaking down the yellowed surface compounds -- sunlight accelerates the effect. Baking soda paste abrades the outermost yellowed layer, exposing whiter material beneath. Dish soap lifts accumulated fingerprint oils and dust.

## Tips

- Severely yellowed covers from decades of exposure may not fully restore. Replace them instead.
- Clean every 6-12 months. Kitchens and bathrooms need more frequent attention.
- For stronger whitening, apply 40-volume hydrogen peroxide cream and set in direct sunlight for 2-4 hours.
- While covers are off, inspect the electrical box for scorching or loose wires.
- Photo each cover's location before removal -- older homes may have slightly different sizes per outlet.
