## Steps

1. Turn off the circuit breaker for the area where you will be removing covers. Use a voltage tester to confirm the outlets are not live.
2. Remove the outlet and switch plate covers by unscrewing the center screw. Place all screws in a small dish so they do not get lost.
3. Fill a basin or sink with 2 cups of warm water, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide. Stir to combine.
4. Submerge the cover plates in the solution and let them soak for 20-30 minutes.
5. After soaking, scrub each cover with an old toothbrush, paying attention to the edges, screw hole area, and any textured surfaces that trap grime.
6. For yellowed covers, make a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide and apply it to the yellowed areas. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then scrub.
7. Rinse all covers under clean running water and dry thoroughly with a clean towel.
8. Reinstall the covers once they are completely dry. Tighten screws snugly but do not over-torque, which can crack the plastic. Turn the circuit breaker back on.

## Why It Works

Outlet covers yellow over time due to a process called photo-oxidation. The bromine-based flame retardants mixed into the ABS plastic react with ultraviolet light, forming brominated compounds on the surface that appear yellow-brown. This is the same process that turns old computer casings and game consoles yellow. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that can partially reverse this yellowing by breaking down the surface brominated compounds. The UV component of indoor lighting accelerates this reaction -- if you place the soaked covers in direct sunlight for 30 minutes, the whitening effect is stronger. Baking soda paste provides gentle abrasion that removes the outermost layer of yellowed plastic, exposing the whiter material beneath. The dish soap addresses the separate problem of accumulated fingerprint oils and household dust that darkens covers over time.

## Tips

- If covers are severely yellowed from decades of UV exposure, even hydrogen peroxide will not fully restore them. At that point, replacement is more effective.
- Clean covers every 6-12 months. Kitchens and bathrooms need cleaning more frequently due to grease and humidity.
- For a stronger whitening treatment, apply hydrogen peroxide cream (hair developer, 40 volume) and set the covers in direct sunlight for 2-4 hours. Rinse thoroughly afterward.
- While the covers are off, inspect the electrical box for any signs of scorching, loose wires, or damage. Report any concerns to a licensed electrician.
- Take a photo of each cover's location before removal. In older homes, covers may be slightly different sizes and only fit their original outlet.
