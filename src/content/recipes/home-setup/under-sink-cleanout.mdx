## Steps

1. Remove everything from under the sink. Inspect the cabinet floor and walls for signs of water damage, mold, or pest activity. Address any leaks before proceeding.
2. Vacuum or wipe out loose debris, dust, and any dried spills from the cabinet floor and walls.
3. Mix 1 cup of white vinegar, 2 cups of warm water, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 10 drops of tea tree essential oil in a spray bottle or bowl.
4. Spray or wipe the cleaning solution onto all interior surfaces of the cabinet: floor, walls, and the underside of the sink basin.
5. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of baking soda directly onto any stained, sticky, or discolored areas. Let it fizz on contact with the vinegar solution for 2-3 minutes.
6. Scrub stained areas with a damp rag, then wipe all surfaces thoroughly with a clean, damp towel.
7. Dry all surfaces completely with a dry towel. Moisture left behind promotes mold growth.
8. Let the cabinet air out with the door open for at least 30 minutes before replacing items. Consider lining the cabinet floor with a washable shelf liner for easier future cleaning.

## Why It Works

Under-sink cabinets are the most neglected and most contamination-prone storage area in most homes. Condensation from cold-water pipes, minor drips from supply line connections, and splashes from garbage disposals create a consistently damp environment. This moisture supports mold and mildew growth, attracts pests, and causes wood particleboard to swell and deteriorate. The vinegar solution acidifies the surfaces, killing mold and mildew on contact. Tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) provides additional antifungal activity -- studies have shown that its terpinen-4-ol content disrupts fungal cell membranes. Baking soda provides physical abrasion for stuck-on residue and neutralizes the sour smell that develops from moisture damage. Thorough drying is critical because even the best antimicrobial treatment is temporary if the underlying moisture problem persists.

## Tips

- Do this cleaning every 3-6 months, and always immediately after discovering a leak.
- If you find mold, wear gloves and consider a mask. For mold covering an area larger than about 10 square feet, consult a professional.
- Shelf liner on the cabinet floor makes future cleanups much easier and protects the wood from moisture damage.
- Organize under-sink items in a removable caddy or bin so you can pull everything out quickly for cleaning.
- A small battery-powered moisture alarm placed on the cabinet floor can alert you to leaks before they cause damage.
