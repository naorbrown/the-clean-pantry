## Steps

1. Remove everything. Inspect for water damage, mold, or pest activity. Address any leaks first.
2. Vacuum or wipe out loose debris and dried spills.
3. Mix 1 cup white vinegar, 2 cups warm water, 1 tsp dish soap, and 10 drops tea tree oil in a spray bottle.
4. Spray all interior surfaces: floor, walls, and underside of the sink basin.
5. Sprinkle 1/4 cup baking soda on stained or discolored areas. Let fizz 2-3 minutes.
6. Scrub stains with a damp rag, then wipe all surfaces with a clean towel.
7. Dry completely. Residual moisture promotes mold.
8. Air out with the door open 30 minutes before replacing items. Line with washable shelf liner.

## Why It Works

Condensation, minor drips, and disposal splashes create a consistently damp environment under sinks. Vinegar acidifies surfaces, killing mold and mildew on contact. Tea tree oil disrupts fungal cell membranes for additional antifungal action. Baking soda provides abrasion for stuck-on residue and neutralizes sour odors. Thorough drying is critical -- antimicrobial treatment is temporary if moisture persists.

## Tips

- Clean every 3-6 months, and immediately after discovering a leak.
- For mold larger than ~10 square feet, consult a professional.
- Organize items in a removable caddy or bin for quick removal.
- A battery-powered moisture alarm on the cabinet floor can catch leaks early.
