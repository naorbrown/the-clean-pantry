## Steps

1. Mix 1/4 cup isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 1/4 cup distilled water in a small spray bottle. Add 5 drops essential oil if desired.
2. Spray onto a microfiber cloth until damp, not dripping. Never spray directly onto the switch.
3. Wipe the toggle or button firmly. For rocker switches, wipe both top and bottom.
4. Wipe the cover plate, edges, and gap between plate and wall.
5. Run a cotton swab dipped in solution along the crevice where the toggle meets the plate.
6. Wipe the wall area immediately surrounding the cover plate.
7. Buff with a dry microfiber cloth.
8. Work through the house systematically. Prioritize bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom switches.

## Why It Works

Light switches harbor more bacteria per square inch than many bathroom surfaces. The 70% alcohol denatures bacterial and viral proteins with ~30 seconds of wet contact. Higher concentrations (90-99%) evaporate too fast to be effective. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on white plates. Tea tree oil adds residual antimicrobial activity after the alcohol evaporates.

## Tips

- Clean weekly during cold and flu season, monthly otherwise.
- Yellowed plates from UV exposure will not restore with cleaning. Replace them -- they are inexpensive.
- For smart switches and dimmers, use lighter pressure and avoid pooling liquid at the edges.
- Do not forget the garage door button, thermostat, and alarm panel.
