## Steps

1. Mix 1/4 cup of isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 1/4 cup of distilled water in a small spray bottle. Add 5 drops of essential oil if desired.
2. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth until it is damp but not dripping. Never spray directly onto the light switch.
3. Wipe the light switch toggle or button, pressing firmly to clean all surfaces. For rocker-style switches, wipe both the top and bottom of the rocker.
4. Wipe the cover plate around the switch, including the edges and the small gap between the plate and the wall.
5. Dip a cotton swab in the solution and run it along the crevice where the switch toggle meets the cover plate. This gap traps grime and bacteria.
6. Wipe the wall area immediately surrounding the cover plate -- fingerprints and smudges often extend beyond the plate itself.
7. Buff with a dry microfiber cloth to remove any streaks.
8. Move through the house systematically, cleaning every switch. Pay extra attention to bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom switches, which get the heaviest use.

## Why It Works

Light switches are among the most frequently touched surfaces in a home, yet they are almost never cleaned. Studies have found that light switches harbor more bacteria per square inch than many bathroom surfaces, including species like Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli transferred from hands. The 70% isopropyl alcohol solution is the gold standard for surface disinfection because the 30% water content slows evaporation enough to give the alcohol adequate contact time (approximately 30 seconds) to denature bacterial and viral proteins. Higher concentrations (90-99%) evaporate too quickly for effective disinfection. The distilled water prevents mineral spots that tap water would leave on white cover plates. Tea tree oil provides a residual antimicrobial effect that persists after the alcohol evaporates.

## Tips

- Clean light switches weekly during cold and flu season, and at least monthly otherwise.
- If the cover plate is yellowed from age, the alcohol solution will not fix discoloration caused by UV exposure on old plastic. Replacement plates are inexpensive.
- For smart switches and dimmer controls with touch-sensitive surfaces, use the same method but with lighter pressure. Avoid letting liquid pool around the edges of electronic controls.
- Do not forget the garage door button, thermostat, and alarm panel -- these are also high-touch surfaces that rarely get cleaned.
- This same solution works for cleaning cabinet handles, drawer pulls, and appliance handles throughout the house.
