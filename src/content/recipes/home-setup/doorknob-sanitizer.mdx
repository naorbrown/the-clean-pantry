## Steps

1. Mix 1 cup of isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 1 cup of distilled water in a 16 oz spray bottle. Add 10 drops of tea tree or thyme essential oil. Shake gently.
2. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth. The cloth should be damp, not dripping.
3. Grip the doorknob with the cloth and turn your hand around it, wiping the entire surface. For lever-style handles, wipe the top, bottom, and sides of the lever.
4. Wipe the area around the keyhole and the escutcheon plate (the decorative plate behind the knob).
5. For deadbolts, wipe the thumb turn on the interior side and the keyhole surround on the exterior.
6. Buff with a dry section of the cloth to remove moisture and prevent water spots on metal finishes.
7. Work through every door in the house, including closet doors, pantry doors, and cabinet pulls.
8. For a complete high-touch surface pass, also wipe stair railings, cabinet pulls, and appliance handles while you are at it.

## Why It Works

Doorknobs are touched dozens of times per day by every member of the household, making them one of the most significant fomite surfaces (objects that transmit pathogens) in a home. Research has demonstrated that influenza virus can survive on stainless steel doorknobs for up to 48 hours, and norovirus can persist for days. The 70% isopropyl alcohol solution works by denaturing the protein coats and dissolving the lipid membranes of bacteria and enveloped viruses on contact. The 30% water content is essential -- it slows evaporation to give the alcohol approximately 30 seconds of wet contact time, which is the minimum needed for effective microbial kill. Thyme essential oil contains thymol, a phenolic compound recognized by the EPA as a disinfectant active ingredient that provides residual antimicrobial activity after the alcohol evaporates.

## Tips

- Clean doorknobs at least weekly, and daily during illness in the household. This is one of the most effective ways to reduce transmission of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses between family members.
- Do not use this solution on unlacquered brass, copper, or antique hardware. The alcohol can strip patina and damage finish. For those surfaces, use plain soap and water.
- Chrome, stainless steel, and lacquered metal finishes are all safe for regular alcohol cleaning.
- The front door exterior handle is the dirtiest knob in the house because it is touched by everyone who enters, including delivery personnel and visitors. Prioritize it.
- Make this a habit by keeping the spray bottle and a cloth in a cleaning caddy that you carry through the house once a week.
