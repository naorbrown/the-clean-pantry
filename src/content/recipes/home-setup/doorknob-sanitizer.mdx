## Steps

1. Mix 1 cup isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 1 cup distilled water in a 16 oz spray bottle. Add 10 drops tea tree or thyme essential oil. Shake gently.
2. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth until damp, not dripping.
3. Grip the doorknob with the cloth and turn your hand around it. For lever handles, wipe top, bottom, and sides.
4. Wipe the keyhole area and escutcheon plate.
5. For deadbolts, wipe the interior thumb turn and exterior keyhole surround.
6. Buff with a dry section of the cloth to prevent water spots.
7. Work through every door in the house, including closets, pantry, and cabinet pulls.
8. Also wipe stair railings, cabinet pulls, and appliance handles.

## Why It Works

Influenza virus survives on stainless steel doorknobs up to 48 hours; norovirus persists for days. The 70% alcohol denatures proteins and dissolves lipid membranes on contact. The 30% water slows evaporation enough for the ~30 seconds of wet contact needed for effective kill. Thymol in thyme essential oil is an EPA-recognized disinfectant that provides residual antimicrobial activity after the alcohol evaporates.

## Tips

- Clean weekly, daily during household illness.
- Chrome, stainless steel, and lacquered finishes are all safe for regular alcohol cleaning.
- Prioritize the front door exterior handle -- it gets the most outside contact.
- Keep the spray bottle and cloth in a caddy you carry through the house.
