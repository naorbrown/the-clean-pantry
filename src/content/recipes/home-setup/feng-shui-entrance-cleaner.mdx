## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water.
2. Add 1 tbsp sea salt and stir until dissolved.
3. Add 1/4 cup white vinegar and 5 drops lemon essential oil. Stir gently.
4. Wring a mop or cloth in the solution until damp. Mop from the far end toward the front door.
5. Pay extra attention to the door threshold.
6. Wipe the area just outside your front door if accessible (porch, landing, or doorstep).
7. Let the floor air dry. No rinsing needed.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's mild acidity breaks down dirt, bacteria, and oily shoe residue. Dissolved salt adds gentle abrasion that lifts grime from grout and textured surfaces. Lemon essential oil leaves a bright, clean scent at the point of entry.

## Tips

- Works well as a weekly ritual. Pick a consistent day to reset.
- Focus on the area within 3-4 feet of your front door in both directions.
- Pair with decluttering the entryway -- remove shoes, bags, and coats that do not belong.
- For natural stone floors, skip the vinegar. Use warm water with salt and lemon oil only.
- In apartments, focus on your doormat area and the floor just inside your door.
