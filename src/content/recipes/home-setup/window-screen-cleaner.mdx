## Steps

1. Remove the window screens from their frames. Most pop out from the inside by pulling the spring tabs or lifting out of the track. Note which screen goes in which window if they are different sizes.
2. Lay the screens flat on a clean surface outdoors (driveway, patio, or on a drop cloth on the lawn).
3. Mix 1 gallon of warm water with 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 1/4 cup of white vinegar in a bucket.
4. Rinse each screen with a gentle stream from a garden hose to remove loose dust, pollen, and cobwebs. Use low pressure to avoid denting or stretching the mesh.
5. Dip a soft bristle brush into the soapy solution and gently scrub both sides of each screen using light, even strokes. Work from top to bottom.
6. Rinse thoroughly with the garden hose until all soap is removed. Soap residue left on the mesh will attract dirt faster.
7. Shake off excess water and lean the screens against a wall in the shade to air dry. Direct sunlight can warp plastic frames.
8. Once completely dry, reinstall the screens. Check the rubber spline (the strip that holds the mesh in the frame) and replace any sections that are cracked or pulling out.

## Why It Works

Window screens accumulate a dense layer of dust, pollen, insect debris, and airborne grease over each season. This buildup restricts airflow by as much as 50% and gives incoming air a stale smell. The dish soap's surfactants break the surface tension that binds fine dust particles and pollen grains to the mesh fibers. Vinegar dissolves the mineral deposits that form when rain water dries on the screen, leaving behind calcium and magnesium spots that bind dust more firmly. The soft brush is essential because window screen mesh (whether fiberglass or aluminum) is thin and flexible. Aggressive scrubbing with stiff bristles can stretch fiberglass mesh permanently or bend aluminum mesh out of its grid pattern. Laying screens flat during cleaning distributes the brush pressure evenly and prevents frame distortion that occurs when cleaning screens vertically.

## Tips

- Clean window screens twice a year: once in spring before opening windows for the season, and once in fall before storage.
- If you do not have outdoor space, clean screens in the bathtub. Lay them flat and use a handheld shower head for rinsing.
- For screens with heavy pollen buildup (common in spring), rinse with the hose first, then soak them lying flat for 10 minutes in the soapy solution before scrubbing.
- While the screens are out, clean the window tracks and sills. This is the only convenient time to access those surfaces.
- Inspect the mesh for holes or tears while cleaning. Small holes can be patched with screen repair tape available at hardware stores.
