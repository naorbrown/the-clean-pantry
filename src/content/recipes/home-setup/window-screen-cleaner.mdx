## Steps

1. Remove screens from their frames. Note which screen fits which window.
2. Lay flat on a clean outdoor surface.
3. Mix 1 gallon warm water, 1 tbsp dish soap, and 1/4 cup white vinegar in a bucket.
4. Rinse each screen with a gentle hose stream. Use low pressure to avoid denting mesh.
5. Scrub both sides with a soft brush dipped in the soapy solution, top to bottom.
6. Rinse thoroughly until all soap is removed.
7. Shake off excess water and lean in the shade to dry. Sunlight can warp plastic frames.
8. Reinstall when dry. Check the rubber spline and replace any cracked sections.

## Why It Works

Screen buildup can restrict airflow by up to 50%. Dish soap surfactants break the surface tension binding dust and pollen to mesh fibers. Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits left by dried rainwater. A soft brush is essential -- stiff bristles can stretch fiberglass mesh or bend aluminum. Laying screens flat distributes pressure evenly and prevents frame distortion.

## Tips

- Clean window screens twice a year: once in spring before opening windows for the season, and once in fall before storage.
- If you do not have outdoor space, clean screens in the bathtub. Lay them flat and use a handheld shower head for rinsing.
- For screens with heavy pollen buildup (common in spring), rinse with the hose first, then soak them lying flat for 10 minutes in the soapy solution before scrubbing.
- While the screens are out, clean the window tracks and sills. This is the only convenient time to access those surfaces.
- Inspect the mesh for holes or tears while cleaning. Small holes can be patched with screen repair tape available at hardware stores.
