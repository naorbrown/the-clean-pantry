## Steps

1. Strip all bedding from the mattress, including the mattress pad and any protectors.
2. Combine 1 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup of cornstarch in a bowl. Add 15 drops of essential oil and stir with a fork until evenly distributed.
3. Using a fine mesh sifter, sprinkle the powder evenly across the entire mattress surface. Pay extra attention to areas where you sleep and any stained spots.
4. Gently pat the powder into the mattress surface with your hands. Do not rub vigorously -- you want the powder to settle into the fabric, not push through to the foam.
5. Let the powder sit for at least 45 minutes. For stubborn odors, leave it for 2-4 hours or an entire afternoon.
6. Vacuum the entire mattress surface thoroughly using the upholstery attachment. Make slow, overlapping passes to ensure you remove all the powder.
7. Flip or rotate the mattress according to the manufacturer's recommendations (if applicable) and repeat on the other side for a complete refresh.
8. Remake the bed with fresh, clean linens.

## Why It Works

Mattresses absorb sweat, skin oils, and body odor over time. An average person releases about half a pint of moisture per night through sweat, much of which is absorbed by the mattress. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic volatile fatty acids (like isovaleric acid) that cause body odor through acid-base reactions. Cornstarch absorbs residual moisture from the mattress surface, as its starch granules readily bind water molecules. Together, they address both the chemical odors and the moisture that sustains odor-producing bacteria. Lavender essential oil contributes linalool and linalyl acetate, compounds with documented antimicrobial properties that reduce the bacterial population on the mattress surface. The extended sitting time allows the powder to absorb deeply, reaching odor compounds that have migrated below the surface fabric.

## Tips

- Freshen your mattress every time you change the sheets -- about every 2-4 weeks. This prevents odor buildup from becoming entrenched.
- If you have a memory foam mattress, vacuum on a lower suction setting to avoid pulling at the foam through the cover.
- Open a bedroom window while the powder sits. Sunlight and fresh air complement the deodorizing treatment.
- For spot stains, make a paste of baking soda and a few drops of hydrogen peroxide, apply to the stain, let it dry, then vacuum. Do not saturate the mattress.
- A mattress protector dramatically extends the time between deep cleanings by blocking sweat, oils, and dust mites from reaching the mattress itself.
