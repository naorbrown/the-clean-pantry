## Steps

1. Strip all bedding, including the mattress pad and protectors.
2. Combine 1 cup baking soda and 1/2 cup cornstarch. Add 15 drops essential oil and stir with a fork.
3. Sift the powder evenly across the mattress surface. Focus on sleep areas and stains.
4. Gently pat the powder into the fabric. Do not rub.
5. Let sit at least 45 minutes. For stubborn odors, leave 2-4 hours.
6. Vacuum thoroughly with the upholstery attachment using slow, overlapping passes.
7. Flip or rotate the mattress and repeat on the other side.
8. Remake the bed with fresh linens.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes the acidic compounds that cause body odor. Cornstarch absorbs residual moisture from the mattress surface. Together they address both odors and the dampness that sustains bacteria. Lavender essential oil has antimicrobial properties that reduce surface bacteria. Extended sitting time lets the powder reach odor compounds below the surface.

## Tips

- Freshen every time you change sheets, about every 2-4 weeks.
- For memory foam, vacuum on lower suction to avoid pulling at the foam.
- Open a window while the powder sits for fresh air circulation.
- For spot stains, apply a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, let dry, then vacuum.
- A mattress protector extends time between deep cleanings significantly.
