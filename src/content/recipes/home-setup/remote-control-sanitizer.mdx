## Steps

1. Remove the batteries from the remote control. This prevents any electrical issues if a small amount of liquid reaches the circuit board.
2. Hold the remote upside down and tap it firmly against your palm several times to dislodge crumbs, dust, and debris from between the buttons.
3. Mix 2 tablespoons of isopropyl alcohol with 2 tablespoons of distilled water in a small dish.
4. Dampen a microfiber cloth with the solution -- wring it out thoroughly so it is barely damp. Wipe down the entire front, back, and sides of the remote.
5. Dip a cotton swab in the solution, squeeze out the excess, and carefully clean around each button, in the seams between the button and the housing, and around the battery compartment.
6. Use a wooden toothpick wrapped in a small piece of damp cloth to clean the narrow gaps and crevices that the cotton swab cannot reach.
7. Wipe the remote once more with a dry microfiber cloth to remove any remaining moisture.
8. Let the remote air dry for 5 minutes, then replace the batteries.

## Why It Works

Remote controls are one of the most germ-laden objects in any home. Multiple family members handle them with unwashed hands, while eating, and while sick. Studies have found that TV remotes in households harbor significant concentrations of bacteria, including Staphylococcus and coliform bacteria. The recessed areas around buttons trap skin oils, food particles, and moisture, creating ideal conditions for microbial growth. Isopropyl alcohol at 70% concentration denatures bacterial proteins and dissolves the lipid membranes of enveloped viruses within 30 seconds of wet contact. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits in the crevices, and the 30% water content slows evaporation enough for effective disinfection. The cotton swab technique is necessary because the recessed button areas cannot be reached by a flat cloth wipe, and these crevices harbor the highest concentration of contamination.

## Tips

- Clean remote controls weekly, and immediately when someone in the household is sick.
- The most contaminated area is around the most-used buttons (power, volume, channel). Focus your cotton swab work there.
- For gaming controllers, the same method applies. Pay special attention to the analog stick bases and trigger mechanisms where skin oils accumulate.
- If the remote has a sticky residue from food or drinks, slightly increase the alcohol concentration to help dissolve it.
- Consider wrapping remotes in a thin silicone sleeve if small children use them frequently. The sleeve can be removed and washed.
