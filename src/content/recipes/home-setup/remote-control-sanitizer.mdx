## Steps

1. Remove the batteries.
2. Hold the remote upside down and tap firmly against your palm to dislodge debris.
3. Mix 2 tbsp isopropyl alcohol with 2 tbsp distilled water in a small dish.
4. Wring a microfiber cloth in the solution until barely damp. Wipe front, back, and sides.
5. Clean around each button and battery compartment with a cotton swab dipped in solution.
6. Wrap a wooden toothpick in damp cloth to clean narrow gaps the swab cannot reach.
7. Wipe once more with a dry microfiber cloth.
8. Air dry 5 minutes, then replace batteries.

## Why It Works

Recessed button areas trap skin oils, food particles, and moisture -- ideal for microbial growth. The 70% alcohol denatures bacterial proteins and dissolves viral membranes within 30 seconds of wet contact. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits in crevices. Cotton swabs are necessary because flat cloth cannot reach the most contaminated areas around buttons.

## Tips

- Clean weekly, and immediately during household illness.
- For gaming controllers, pay special attention to analog stick bases and trigger mechanisms.
- For sticky food or drink residue, increase the alcohol concentration slightly.
- Silicone remote sleeves can be removed and washed -- useful with small children.
