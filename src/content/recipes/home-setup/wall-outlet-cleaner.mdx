## Steps

1. **Turn off the circuit breaker** for the room you're working in. Test the outlet with a phone charger to confirm it's off.
2. Use a dry cotton swab to brush dust away from the face of each outlet and switch plate.
3. For cover plates: wipe with a microfiber cloth dampened with the alcohol-water solution. This removes fingerprints, grease, and yellowing.
4. For the outlet openings themselves: use a dry cotton swab only — never wet.
5. If you're comfortable removing cover plates (one Phillips screw), take them off and wash in warm soapy water, dry thoroughly, and reinstall.
6. Clean light switches the same way — they collect more fingerprint oil than you'd expect.
7. Turn the circuit breaker back on when everything is dry.

## Why It Works

Outlet cover plates yellow over time from UV exposure and skin oils. A quick alcohol wipe restores them. Dust inside outlets reduces contact quality and in extreme cases contributes to overheating. The circuit breaker step makes this completely safe — no electricity flowing means no risk.

## Tips

- Add this to your deep-cleaning rotation every 3–6 months
- Kitchen and bathroom outlets collect more grease and moisture — clean them more often
- Painted-over outlet covers can be swapped for new ones cheaply at any hardware store
- USB wall outlets collect pocket lint — use a dry toothpick to clear the ports
