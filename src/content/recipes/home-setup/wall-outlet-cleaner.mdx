## Steps

1. **Turn off the circuit breaker** for the room. Confirm with a phone charger.
2. Brush dust from each outlet and switch plate with a dry cotton swab.
3. Wipe cover plates with a microfiber cloth dampened with the alcohol-water solution.
4. For outlet openings: dry cotton swab only -- never wet.
5. Optionally remove cover plates (one Phillips screw), wash in warm soapy water, dry, and reinstall.
6. Clean light switches the same way.
7. Turn the breaker back on when everything is dry.

## Why It Works

Cover plates yellow from UV exposure and skin oils; alcohol reverses this. Dust inside outlets reduces contact quality and can contribute to overheating. Turning off the breaker eliminates all electrical risk.

## Tips

- Add this to your deep-cleaning rotation every 3–6 months
- Kitchen and bathroom outlets collect more grease and moisture — clean them more often
- Painted-over outlet covers can be swapped for new ones cheaply at any hardware store
- USB wall outlets collect pocket lint — use a dry toothpick to clear the ports
