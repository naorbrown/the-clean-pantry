## Steps

1. Mix 2 tbsp baking soda, 1 tbsp water, and 1 tsp white toothpaste into a thick paste.
2. Test on an inconspicuous area first. Wait 2 minutes, wipe off, and check for damage.
3. Apply a small amount to a soft, damp sponge.
4. Rub over the scuff in small circular motions with light to moderate pressure.
5. Rub 10-15 seconds per scuff. For stubborn marks, let paste sit 2 minutes before rubbing again.
6. Wipe with a clean, damp cloth to remove paste residue.
7. If a faint mark remains after drying, repeat once.
8. Final wipe with a damp cloth to remove any powdery residue.

## Why It Works

Scuffs are rubber or polymer deposits sitting on top of the paint film. Baking soda (Mohs hardness 2.5) is soft enough to spare paint (hardness 3-4) but hard enough to lift softer scuff deposits (hardness 1-2). White toothpaste adds mild abrasives and surfactants that dissolve scuff material. Water lubricates to prevent scratching.

## Tips

- Works best on semi-gloss and satin finishes. Flat and matte paints may show shiny spots. Test first.
- Do not use gel or whitening toothpaste. Gel lacks abrasives; whitening formulas can discolor paint.
- Melamine foam erasers are more aggressive -- use this paste first, escalate only for stubborn marks.
- For crayon marks, the toothpaste surfactants dissolve wax especially well.
- Keep a small jar of premixed paste under the sink for quick spot treatments.
