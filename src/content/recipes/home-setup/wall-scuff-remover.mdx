## Steps

1. Mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of water and 1 teaspoon of white toothpaste to form a soft paste. It should have the consistency of thick frosting.
2. Test the paste on an inconspicuous area of the wall (behind furniture or in a closet) to make sure it does not dull or remove the paint. Wait 2 minutes, wipe off, and check.
3. Apply a small amount of paste to a soft, damp sponge.
4. Gently rub the paste over the scuff mark using small circular motions. Apply light to moderate pressure -- enough to feel the baking soda working but not so much that you are grinding into the paint.
5. Continue rubbing for 10-15 seconds per scuff. Most scuffs lift immediately. For stubborn marks, let the paste sit on the scuff for 2 minutes before rubbing again.
6. Wipe the area with a clean, damp cloth to remove all paste residue.
7. Inspect the area once dry. If a faint mark remains, repeat the process once more.
8. Wipe the treated area one final time with a damp cloth to ensure no powdery residue is left behind.

## Why It Works

Scuff marks on walls are typically deposits of rubber or polymer material transferred from shoes, furniture, vacuum cleaners, or toys. The material sits on top of the paint film rather than penetrating it. Baking soda is a mild abrasive with a hardness of 2.5 on the Mohs scale -- soft enough to avoid scratching most paint finishes (which have a hardness of 3-4) but hard enough to mechanically lift the softer rubber or polymer deposits (hardness 1-2). White toothpaste contains additional mild abrasives (calcium carbonate or hydrated silica) and surfactants that help dissolve the scuff material and keep the abrasive particles suspended in a workable paste. The water activates the surfactants and provides lubrication that prevents the abrasive from scratching the paint. This differential hardness approach removes the scuff without affecting the harder paint beneath.

## Tips

- This works best on semi-gloss and satin paint finishes. Flat and matte paints are more porous and may show a shiny spot where you scrub. Always test first.
- Do not use gel toothpaste or "whitening" toothpaste. Gel lacks the abrasive particles needed, and whitening formulas contain bleaching agents that can discolor paint.
- A melamine foam eraser (like Mr. Clean Magic Eraser) works on the same abrasive principle but is more aggressive. Use baking soda paste first and only escalate to melamine foam for stubborn marks.
- For crayon marks (from kids), the toothpaste component is especially helpful because its surfactants dissolve wax.
- Keep a small jar of premixed paste under the kitchen sink for quick spot treatments as scuffs appear.
