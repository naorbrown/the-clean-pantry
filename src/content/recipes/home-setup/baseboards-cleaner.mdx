## Steps

1. Vacuum or dry-dust the baseboards first using a microfiber cloth or the brush attachment on your vacuum. This removes loose dust and prevents it from turning into mud when wet.
2. Mix 2 cups of warm water, 1/4 cup of white vinegar, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 5 drops of essential oil in a spray bottle. Shake gently.
3. Spray a section of baseboard (about 3-4 feet) with the solution. Do not saturate -- a light mist is sufficient.
4. Wipe with a damp microfiber cloth, running it along the length of the baseboard. For long stretches, slip an old sock over your hand for easier wiping along the floor line.
5. For scuff marks or stuck-on grime, spray a bit more solution directly on the spot, let it sit for 1-2 minutes, then scrub gently with the cloth.
6. Wipe each section with a second dry cloth to remove moisture and prevent water from pooling at the base where the board meets the floor.
7. Work room by room, moving furniture as needed to access all baseboards.
8. Once dry, run a dryer sheet along the top edge of the baseboards. The anti-static coating repels dust and extends the time between cleanings.

## Why It Works

Baseboards collect dust through static attraction and gravity -- they sit at the junction of wall and floor where dust naturally settles. The accumulated grime is a mixture of dust, pet hair, skin cells, cooking grease (especially in kitchens), and whatever gets kicked up from the floor. Dish soap contains surfactants that break the surface tension of the oily grime, lifting it off the painted surface so it can be wiped away. Vinegar cuts through the greasy film that cooking vapors deposit on baseboards nearest the kitchen, and its mild acidity helps dissolve mineral splashes from mopping. The dry-dust-first step is important because dust particles mixed with liquid become an abrasive slurry that can scratch paint. The dryer sheet finishing trick works because dryer sheets are coated with a thin layer of quaternary ammonium compounds that carry a positive charge, neutralizing the static charge that attracts negatively charged dust particles.

## Tips

- Clean baseboards every 1-2 months. They are one of those surfaces that you stop noticing until they are very dirty.
- The dryer sheet trick genuinely works and can double the time between cleanings. Replace the anti-static coating each time you clean.
- For kitchens, you may need a slightly stronger solution. Add an extra teaspoon of dish soap for kitchen baseboards.
- When cleaning baseboards, protect your knees with a kneeling pad or folded towel. This makes the task much more comfortable.
- If your baseboards are stained or unfinished wood rather than painted, skip the vinegar and use just warm water with a drop of dish soap.
