## Steps

1. Vacuum or dry-dust the baseboards with a microfiber cloth or brush attachment.
2. Mix 2 cups warm water, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1 tsp dish soap, and 5 drops essential oil in a spray bottle. Shake gently.
3. Lightly mist a 3-4 foot section of baseboard. Do not saturate.
4. Wipe with a damp microfiber cloth along the length. For long stretches, slip an old sock over your hand.
5. For scuff marks, spray the spot directly, let sit 1-2 minutes, then scrub with the cloth.
6. Dry each section with a second cloth to prevent water pooling at the base.
7. Work room by room, moving furniture as needed.
8. Run a dryer sheet along the top edge of dry baseboards to repel dust.

## Why It Works

Dish soap surfactants break the surface tension of oily grime, lifting it off painted surfaces. Vinegar cuts greasy kitchen film and dissolves mineral splashes from mopping. Dry-dusting first prevents wet dust from forming an abrasive slurry that scratches paint. Dryer sheets carry a positive charge that neutralizes the static attracting dust to baseboards.

## Tips

- Clean every 1-2 months.
- For kitchens, add an extra teaspoon of dish soap.
- Protect your knees with a kneeling pad or folded towel.
- For stained or unfinished wood, skip the vinegar and use warm water with a drop of dish soap.
