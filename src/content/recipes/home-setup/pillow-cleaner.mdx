## Steps

1. Check the care label. Safe for polyester, down, and down-alternative. Do not machine wash memory foam or latex.
2. Remove pillowcase and protector. Patch any tears in the shell before washing.
3. Place 2 pillows in the machine to balance the load. Top-loaders: place vertically.
4. Fill with hot water. Add 1/2 cup washing soda, 1 tbsp dish soap, and 1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide. Soak 15-20 minutes.
5. Run a full hot wash. Add 1/2 cup white vinegar during the rinse cycle.
6. Run an extra rinse and spin to remove all soap residue.
7. Transfer to dryer with 3 dryer balls or clean tennis balls.
8. Dry on low heat 60-90 minutes. Squeeze the center to confirm fully dry before use.

## Why It Works

Pillow yellowing is oxidized sweat and body oil hardened into the fabric. Washing soda breaks down these polymerized oils. Hydrogen peroxide reverses yellowing by breaking the oxidized bonds. Dish soap emulsifies body oils so they flush away. Vinegar in the rinse dissolves alkaline residue and softens fabric without coating it. Dryer balls physically fluff the fill to prevent clumping.

## Tips

- Wash every 3-4 months, or when yellowing shows through the pillowcase.
- If a pillow folds in half and does not spring back, replace it.
- For down pillows, use a gentler cycle and keep dryer heat on low.
- Use zippered pillow protectors to extend time between deep washes.
