## Steps

1. Check the pillow care label. This method is safe for polyester fill, down, and down-alternative pillows. Do not machine wash memory foam or latex.
2. Remove the pillowcase and any pillow protector. Check the pillow shell for tears -- patch any holes before washing to prevent fill from escaping.
3. Place 2 pillows in the washing machine to balance the load. For top-loaders, place them vertically.
4. Fill the machine with hot water. Add 1/2 cup washing soda, 1 tablespoon liquid dish soap, and 1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide. Let the pillows soak for 15-20 minutes before starting the cycle.
5. Run a full wash cycle on the hottest setting. Add 1/2 cup white vinegar during the rinse cycle (via the fabric softener dispenser or manually at the start of the rinse).
6. Run an extra rinse and spin cycle to ensure all soap is removed. Pillows hold a lot of water and residual soap causes them to feel stiff.
7. Transfer pillows to the dryer. Add 3 dryer balls or clean tennis balls to the dryer -- these pound the pillow fill back into shape as it dries.
8. Dry on low heat for 60-90 minutes, checking every 30 minutes. The pillow must be completely dry throughout before use. Squeeze the center to check for dampness.

## Why It Works

Pillows accumulate sweat, saliva, skin oils, and dead skin cells over time, creating a rich environment for dust mites and bacteria. The yellow discoloration on pillows is oxidized sweat and body oil that has polymerized (bonded with oxygen and hardened) into the fabric. Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is a stronger alkali than baking soda and effectively breaks down these polymerized oils. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing bleach that reverses the yellowing by breaking the chemical bonds in the oxidized compounds. The dish soap cuts grease and emulsifies the body oils so they can be flushed away. White vinegar in the rinse dissolves any remaining alkaline residue and softens the fabric without leaving a coating the way fabric softener does. The dryer balls physically fluff the fill, preventing the clumping that makes washed pillows lumpy.

## Tips

- Wash pillows every 3-4 months, or when they start to look yellow even through the pillowcase.
- The tennis ball trick in the dryer is essential. Without it, the fill clumps into dense wads that never fully loft back up.
- If a pillow folds in half and does not spring back, it has lost its structural integrity and should be replaced, not washed.
- For down pillows, use a gentler cycle and ensure the dryer temperature stays on low. High heat can damage the down clusters.
- Use pillow protectors (zippered covers beneath the pillowcase) to dramatically extend the time between deep washes.
