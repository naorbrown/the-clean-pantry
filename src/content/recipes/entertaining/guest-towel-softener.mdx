## Steps

1. Load guest towels into the washing machine and run a normal wash cycle with your regular detergent.
2. When the rinse cycle begins, add 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the fabric softener dispenser. If your machine does not have one, add it manually at the start of the rinse cycle.
3. Complete the full wash and rinse cycle.
4. Transfer towels to the dryer. Dry on medium heat with wool dryer balls if you have them, or dry on a line in the sun.
5. Fold and place in the guest room while still slightly warm for maximum fluffiness.

## Why It Works

Detergent residue builds up in towel fibers over time, making them stiff and scratchy. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves this residue during the rinse cycle, restoring the natural softness of the cotton fibers. Unlike commercial fabric softeners, vinegar does not leave a waxy coating that reduces towel absorbency. The result is towels that are both softer and more absorbent.

## Tips

- The vinegar smell disappears completely during drying. Your towels will not smell like vinegar.
- Avoid using commercial fabric softener on towels -- it coats the fibers with silicone and reduces their ability to absorb water.
- Wash guest towels separately from kitchen towels or rags to keep them looking their best.
