## Steps

1. Wash guest towels on a normal cycle with your regular detergent.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the fabric softener dispenser at the rinse cycle.
3. Complete the full wash and rinse cycle.
4. Dry on medium heat with wool dryer balls, or line dry in the sun.
5. Fold and place in the guest room while still slightly warm.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid dissolves detergent residue that makes towels stiff and scratchy. Unlike commercial fabric softeners, vinegar leaves no waxy coating, so towels stay absorbent.

## Tips

- Avoid commercial fabric softener on towels -- silicone coatings reduce absorbency.
- Wash guest towels separately from kitchen towels or rags.
