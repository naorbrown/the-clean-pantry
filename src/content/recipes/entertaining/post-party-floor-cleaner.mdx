## Steps

1. Fill a mop bucket with 1 gallon of warm water.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 2 tablespoons of castile soap. Stir gently to combine without creating excessive suds.
3. Sweep or vacuum the floor first to remove loose debris, crumbs, and any broken glass.
4. Dip your mop into the solution, wring it until damp (not dripping), and mop in sections.
5. For sticky spots (dried drink spills, dropped food), let the mop sit on the spot for 30 seconds before scrubbing.
6. Rinse the mop head frequently in the solution.
7. Allow the floor to air dry or go over it once with a dry mop for faster drying.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant that breaks down grease, sugar residue, and ground-in dirt from foot traffic. Vinegar cuts through sticky drink spills and dissolves any residual film. The warm water improves the cleaning power of both ingredients by softening dried-on messes. Together they handle the heavy-duty mess of a post-party floor without leaving chemical residue.

## Tips

- Use less castile soap rather than more. Too much creates a soapy film on the floor that attracts more dirt.
- For tile floors with grout, scrub stained grout lines with a stiff brush dipped in the solution.
- If you have hardwood floors, reduce the vinegar to 1/4 cup to protect the finish, and make sure the mop is well-wrung.
