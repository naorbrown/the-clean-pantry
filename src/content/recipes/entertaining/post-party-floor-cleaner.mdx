## Steps

1. Fill a mop bucket with 1 gallon of warm water.
2. Add 1/2 cup white vinegar and 2 tablespoons castile soap. Stir gently.
3. Sweep or vacuum first to remove debris, crumbs, and broken glass.
4. Mop in sections with a damp (not dripping) mop.
5. For sticky spots, let the mop sit on the area for 30 seconds before scrubbing.
6. Rinse the mop head frequently.
7. Air dry or go over once with a dry mop.

## Why It Works

Castile soap breaks down grease, sugar, and ground-in dirt. Vinegar cuts through sticky drink spills. Warm water softens dried-on messes.

## Tips

- Less soap is better -- too much leaves a film that attracts dirt.
- For tile grout, scrub stained lines with a stiff brush dipped in the solution.
- On hardwood, reduce vinegar to 1/4 cup and keep the mop well-wrung.
