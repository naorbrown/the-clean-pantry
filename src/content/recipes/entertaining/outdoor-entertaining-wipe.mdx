## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1 cup water, and 1 teaspoon castile soap in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Shake gently to mix.
3. Spray each chair seat, armrest, and backrest generously.
4. Wipe with a clean cloth, focusing on pollen, bird droppings, or sap spots.
5. Spray and wipe the table surface, legs, and umbrella poles.
6. For stubborn spots, let the spray sit 2 minutes before wiping.
7. Air dry in the sun before setting the table.

## Why It Works

Castile soap breaks down sticky organic residue like pollen and sap. Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and kills mold or mildew on outdoor surfaces.

## Tips

- Wipe furniture the morning of your event -- it gets dirty again quickly outdoors.
- For plastic chairs with ground-in grime, scrub with baking soda on a damp cloth before spraying.
- Rinse cushions with the hose and stand on edge to dry in the sun.
