## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of white vinegar, 1 cup of water, and 1 teaspoon of castile soap in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Shake gently to mix without creating too many suds.
3. Spray each chair seat, armrest, and backrest generously.
4. Wipe down with a clean cloth, paying attention to areas where pollen, bird droppings, or tree sap have accumulated.
5. Spray and wipe the table surface, legs, and any umbrella poles.
6. For stubborn spots, spray the area and let it sit for 2 minutes before wiping.
7. Let the furniture air dry in the sun for a few minutes before setting the table.

## Why It Works

Outdoor furniture collects pollen, dust, bird droppings, and tree sap that plain water does not remove. The castile soap acts as a surfactant to break down sticky organic residue, while vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and kills mold or mildew that develop on furniture left outdoors. This combination handles the full range of outdoor grime without damaging metal, plastic, or finished wood surfaces.

## Tips

- Wipe furniture down the morning of your event rather than days in advance -- outdoor furniture gets dirty again quickly.
- For plastic chairs with ground-in grime, sprinkle baking soda on a damp cloth and scrub before spraying.
- Rinse cushions with the garden hose and stand them on edge to dry in the sun.
