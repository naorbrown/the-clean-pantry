## Steps

1. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda directly into the garbage disposal drain.
2. Let the baking soda sit for 2-3 minutes to absorb odors.
3. Drop 1 cup of ice cubes into the disposal.
4. Add the lemon quarters on top of the ice.
5. Turn on the cold water and run the disposal for 20-30 seconds until all the ice and lemon are processed.
6. Let the cold water continue running for another 10 seconds to flush the drain.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes the acidic compounds that cause garbage disposal odors -- primarily from food decomposition. The ice cubes act as a gentle abrasive, knocking loose food particles stuck to the blades and walls of the disposal. Lemon peel contains limonene, a natural degreasing compound that also leaves a fresh citrus scent. Together, they clean, deodorize, and freshen the disposal in under five minutes.

## Tips

- Do this 30 minutes before guests arrive so the kitchen smells fresh when they walk in.
- Any citrus works -- limes, oranges, and grapefruits are equally effective if you do not have lemons.
- Run the disposal with cold water, not hot. Hot water can melt fats and cause them to re-coat the disposal walls.
