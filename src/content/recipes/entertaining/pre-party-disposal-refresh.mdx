## Steps

1. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the disposal drain.
2. Let sit 2-3 minutes to absorb odors.
3. Drop 1 cup of ice cubes into the disposal.
4. Add the lemon quarters on top of the ice.
5. Run the disposal with cold water for 20-30 seconds until everything is processed.
6. Let cold water run 10 more seconds to flush the drain.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes acidic odor compounds from food decomposition. Ice cubes knock loose stuck particles from the blades and walls. Lemon peel's limonene degreases and leaves a fresh citrus scent.

## Tips

- Any citrus works -- limes, oranges, and grapefruits are equally effective.
- Use cold water, not hot. Hot water melts fats and re-coats the disposal walls.
