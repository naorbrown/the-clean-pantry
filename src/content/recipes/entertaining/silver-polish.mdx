## Steps

1. Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil, shiny side up.
2. Place tarnished silverware directly on the foil, ensuring each piece touches it.
3. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of baking soda over the silverware.
4. Pour 4 cups of boiling water over everything. It will fizz -- this is normal.
5. Soak for 5-10 minutes. Tarnish will transfer from the silver to the foil.
6. Remove with tongs and rinse under cool running water.
7. Dry and buff immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth.

## Why It Works

Aluminum donates electrons to silver sulfide (tarnish) through the baking soda solution, converting it back to pure silver. Unlike commercial polish, this removes no silver -- it reverses the tarnish chemically.

## Tips

- Avoid using on pieces where the plating is already thin or worn.
- For heavy tarnish, repeat with fresh foil, baking soda, and water.
- Polish 1-2 days before a dinner party so you are not rushed day-of.
