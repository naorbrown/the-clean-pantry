## Steps

1. Line the bottom of a glass baking dish or heat-safe container with a sheet of aluminum foil, shiny side up.
2. Place the tarnished silverware directly on the foil, making sure each piece touches the foil.
3. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of baking soda evenly over the silverware.
4. Carefully pour 4 cups of boiling water over everything. The solution will fizz and bubble -- this is normal.
5. Let the silverware soak for 5-10 minutes. You will see the tarnish transferring from the silver to the foil.
6. Remove each piece with tongs (the water is still hot) and rinse under cool running water.
7. Dry and buff immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth.

## Why It Works

Silver tarnish is silver sulfide, formed when silver reacts with sulfur compounds in the air. This method uses an electrochemical reaction: the aluminum acts as a sacrificial metal, donating electrons to the silver sulfide through the baking soda solution. This converts the silver sulfide back into pure silver and aluminum sulfide. Unlike commercial silver polish that removes a thin layer of silver, this method reverses the tarnish without removing any silver at all.

## Tips

- This works on real sterling silver and heavily plated silver. Avoid using it on pieces where the plating is already thin or worn.
- For heavily tarnished pieces, repeat the process with fresh foil, baking soda, and water.
- Polish your silverware 1-2 days before a dinner party so you are not rushed on the day of the event.
