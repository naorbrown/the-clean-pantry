## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 1/2 cups of water.
3. Add 10 drops of lavender essential oil and 5 drops of lemon essential oil.
4. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake well to combine.
5. Mist the toilet seat, sink, faucet, and counter surfaces.
6. Let sit for 1 minute, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.
7. Give the air a few quick spritzes for a fresh scent.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid kills common bathroom bacteria on contact while dissolving water spots and soap residue. The lavender and lemon essential oils provide a clean, welcoming scent that masks any lingering bathroom odors without synthetic fragrance chemicals.

## Tips

- Make this bottle the night before a gathering so the oils have time to blend with the vinegar.
- Focus on high-touch surfaces: faucet handles, toilet flush lever, light switches, and doorknobs.
- Keep a dedicated bottle under the guest bathroom sink for quick touch-ups between visitors.
