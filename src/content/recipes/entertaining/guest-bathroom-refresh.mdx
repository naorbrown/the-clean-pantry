## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 1/2 cups of water.
3. Add 10 drops of lavender and 5 drops of lemon essential oil.
4. Shake well to combine.
5. Mist the toilet seat, sink, faucet, and counter surfaces.
6. Let sit for 1 minute, then wipe with a microfiber cloth.
7. Spritz the air a few times for a fresh scent.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid kills common bathroom bacteria and dissolves water spots and soap residue. Lavender and lemon oils provide a clean scent without synthetic fragrance.

## Tips

- Make the bottle the night before so the oils blend with the vinegar.
- Focus on high-touch surfaces: faucet handles, flush lever, light switches, doorknobs.
- Keep a dedicated bottle under the guest bathroom sink for quick touch-ups.
