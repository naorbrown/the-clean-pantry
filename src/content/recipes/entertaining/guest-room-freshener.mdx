## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of lavender essential oil and 5 drops of tea tree essential oil.
3. Shake well before each use -- the oils separate from water when sitting.
4. Mist the room lightly, spraying upward toward the ceiling so the mist falls gently.
5. Spritz pillows and bedding from about 12 inches away.
6. Allow 10 minutes for the scent to settle before guests arrive.

## Why It Works

Lavender essential oil contains linalool and linalyl acetate, compounds shown in studies to have calming and sleep-promoting effects. Tea tree oil provides mild antimicrobial properties that help neutralize airborne bacteria and musty odors. Together they create a clean, relaxing atmosphere without synthetic air freshener chemicals.

## Tips

- Use distilled water for a longer shelf life -- minerals in tap water can cause the spray to develop an off smell over time.
- Shake vigorously before every spray. Essential oils and water do not mix, so the oils float on top when sitting still.
- For a warmer scent, swap tea tree for 5 drops of vanilla extract mixed into the water.
