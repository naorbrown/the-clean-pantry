## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 15 drops of lavender and 5 drops of tea tree essential oil.
3. Shake well before each use.
4. Mist upward toward the ceiling so the spray falls gently.
5. Spritz pillows and bedding from about 12 inches away.
6. Allow 10 minutes for the scent to settle before guests arrive.

## Why It Works

Lavender's linalool promotes calm and sleep. Tea tree oil neutralizes airborne bacteria and musty odors.

## Tips

- Use distilled water for a longer shelf life.
- For a warmer scent, swap tea tree for 5 drops of vanilla extract.
