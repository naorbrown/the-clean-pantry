## Steps

1. Fill a clean basin or large bowl with 4 cups of warm (not hot) water.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar and stir gently.
3. Submerge each glass in the solution for 2-3 minutes to dissolve any water spots or film.
4. Remove each glass and hold it by the base -- avoid touching the bowl of the glass with your fingers.
5. Dry immediately with a lint-free microfiber cloth or flour sack towel, using a gentle polishing motion.
6. Hold each glass up to the light to check for remaining spots. Repeat the dip if needed.

## Why It Works

Hard water minerals like calcium and magnesium leave a cloudy film on glassware over time. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves these mineral deposits on contact, restoring the glass to its original clarity. Drying immediately with a lint-free cloth prevents new water spots from forming as the glass air-dries.

## Tips

- Never put fine crystal in the dishwasher. The high heat and harsh detergents can etch the glass permanently.
- Polish glasses the morning of your event so they sparkle when guests arrive.
- If glasses have stubborn cloudiness, soak them in undiluted white vinegar for 5 minutes before the warm water rinse.
