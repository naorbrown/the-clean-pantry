## Steps

1. Fill a clean basin with 4 cups of warm (not hot) water.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar and stir gently.
3. Submerge each glass for 2-3 minutes.
4. Remove each glass by the base -- avoid touching the bowl.
5. Dry immediately with a lint-free cloth using a gentle polishing motion.
6. Hold each glass up to the light. Repeat the dip if spots remain.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid dissolves calcium and magnesium deposits that cause cloudy film. Immediate drying prevents new water spots from forming.

## Tips

- Never put fine crystal in the dishwasher -- high heat and harsh detergents etch glass permanently.
- For stubborn cloudiness, soak in undiluted white vinegar for 5 minutes before the warm water rinse.
