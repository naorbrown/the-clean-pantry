## Steps

1. Place 4-6 ice cubes in a plastic bag and hold the bag directly on the candle wax for 5-10 minutes. The goal is to freeze the wax solid.
2. Once the wax is completely hard and brittle, use a plastic scraper, credit card edge, or butter knife to gently pry up the wax. Work from the edges inward.
3. Remove as much wax as possible by scraping. Do not force it -- if pieces resist, re-freeze with more ice.
4. Mix 2 tablespoons of white vinegar with 1/4 cup of warm water.
5. Dampen a clean cloth with the vinegar solution and gently rub the remaining wax residue and any oily film left behind.
6. Wipe dry with a clean, dry cloth.
7. For wood surfaces, follow up with a small amount of olive oil on a cloth to restore the finish.

## Why It Works

Freezing makes candle wax contract and become brittle, breaking its bond with the surface underneath. This allows it to be lifted off cleanly without smearing. The vinegar solution dissolves the oily residue that wax leaves behind, which is mainly composed of paraffin or soy-based fats that respond well to mild acid cleaning.

## Tips

- Never try to scrape warm or soft wax -- it will smear and push deeper into the surface grain.
- For wax on fabric (tablecloths, runners), place a paper bag over the wax and iron on low heat. The wax melts and transfers to the paper.
- Use a plastic scraper on finished wood to avoid scratches. Metal tools can gouge soft wood surfaces.
