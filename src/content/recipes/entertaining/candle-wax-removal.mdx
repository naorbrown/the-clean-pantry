## Steps

1. Place 4-6 ice cubes in a plastic bag and hold directly on the wax for 5-10 minutes.
2. Scrape the hardened wax with a plastic scraper or credit card edge, working from edges inward.
3. If pieces resist, re-freeze with more ice and scrape again.
4. Mix 2 tablespoons of white vinegar with 1/4 cup of warm water.
5. Rub the remaining residue with a cloth dampened in the vinegar solution.
6. Wipe dry with a clean cloth.
7. For wood surfaces, follow up with a small amount of olive oil to restore the finish.

## Why It Works

Freezing makes wax contract and become brittle, breaking its bond with the surface. Vinegar dissolves the oily paraffin or soy-based residue left behind.

## Tips

- For wax on fabric, place a paper bag over the wax and iron on low heat. The wax transfers to the paper.
- Use a plastic scraper on finished wood. Metal tools can gouge soft surfaces.
