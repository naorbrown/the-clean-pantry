## Steps

1. For candle wax: place the stained area in the freezer for 20 minutes, then crack off the hardened wax with a butter knife. Skip this step for food and wine stains.
2. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda directly onto the stain and let it sit for 5 minutes to absorb excess moisture and grease.
3. Mix 1 tablespoon of dish soap with 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of warm water in a bowl.
4. Dip a clean cloth into the solution and blot the stain from the outside edges inward. Do not rub -- rubbing spreads the stain and damages fibers.
5. Continue blotting with the solution until the stain lifts.
6. Rinse the treated area under cool running water.
7. Launder the tablecloth as usual. Check that the stain is gone before putting it in the dryer -- heat sets stains permanently.

## Why It Works

Baking soda absorbs liquid and grease from the stain before treatment begins. Dish soap breaks down fats and oils in food and sauce stains, while vinegar's acidity helps dissolve pigments from red wine and tomato-based sauces. The fizzing reaction between baking soda and vinegar also helps lift stain particles from fabric fibers.

## Tips

- Treat stains as soon as possible after the party. Fresh stains come out far more easily than dried ones.
- For red wine specifically, blot immediately with a clean cloth, then cover the stain in salt before applying this treatment. Salt draws out the wine.
- Keep a small spray bottle of the vinegar and dish soap solution pre-mixed for quick access during events.
