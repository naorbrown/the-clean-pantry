## Steps

1. For wax: freeze the stained area 20 minutes, then crack off hardened wax with a butter knife. Skip for food and wine stains.
2. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda on the stain. Let sit 5 minutes.
3. Mix 1 tablespoon dish soap, 1/4 cup white vinegar, and 1 cup warm water.
4. Blot the stain from outside edges inward with a cloth dipped in the solution. Do not rub.
5. Continue blotting until the stain lifts.
6. Rinse under cool running water.
7. Launder as usual. Confirm the stain is gone before using the dryer.

## Why It Works

Baking soda absorbs liquid and grease before treatment. Dish soap breaks down fats and oils. Vinegar dissolves pigments from wine and tomato sauces. The fizzing reaction lifts stain particles from fibers.

## Tips

- Treat stains as soon as possible. Fresh stains lift far more easily than dried ones.
- For red wine, blot immediately, then cover in salt before applying this treatment.
- Keep a pre-mixed spray bottle of the vinegar and dish soap solution for quick access during events.
