## Steps

1. Unplug and disassemble all removable parts: tank, base, tray, wicks, and filters.
2. Pour 2 cups of vinegar into the base. Let soak 20 minutes.
3. Fill the tank with warm water and 1 cup of vinegar. Cap, shake gently, and let sit 20 minutes.
4. Scrub the base with a soft brush, focusing on scale around the heating element or ultrasonic plate.
5. Empty and rinse both the base and tank thoroughly.
6. Pour 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide into the tank, add water to fill halfway, cap, and shake. Let sit 10 minutes.
7. Empty and rinse the tank at least 3 times.
8. Wipe dry and reassemble. Run with plain distilled water for 5 minutes before normal use.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves mineral scale through acid-base reactions. Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria, mold spores, and algae as an oxidizing agent. Used sequentially (never mixed), they provide both descaling and disinfection.

## Tips

- Use distilled water in your humidifier to eliminate mineral scale entirely.
- Never mix vinegar and hydrogen peroxide — combined they form corrosive peracetic acid.
- Replace wicks and filters per manufacturer schedule.
- If the mist smells musty, stop using and clean immediately.
