## Steps

1. Unplug the humidifier and disassemble all removable parts: tank, base, tray, and any removable wicks or filters.
2. Pour 2 cups of white vinegar into the base of the humidifier where the heating element or ultrasonic disc is located. Let it soak for 20 minutes.
3. While the base soaks, fill the water tank with warm water and add 1 cup of white vinegar. Cap the tank, shake gently, and let it sit for 20 minutes.
4. After soaking, use a soft bristle brush to scrub the base, focusing on any visible mineral scale around the heating element or ultrasonic plate.
5. Empty the vinegar from both the base and the tank. Rinse each piece thoroughly with clean water.
6. Pour 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide (3%) into the tank, add water to fill halfway, cap, and shake. Let it sit for 10 minutes to disinfect.
7. Empty and rinse the tank at least 3 times with clean water to remove all cleaning residue.
8. Wipe all parts dry with a clean towel and reassemble. Run the humidifier with plain distilled water for 5 minutes before normal use.

## Why It Works

Humidifiers are ideal breeding grounds for bacteria and mold because they maintain a constantly warm, moist environment. The mineral scale (white crusty deposits) forms when dissolved calcium and magnesium from tap water are left behind as the water evaporates. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves this mineral scale through acid-base reactions. The hydrogen peroxide step serves a different purpose: it is an oxidizing agent that kills bacteria, mold spores, and algae that colonize the damp surfaces. Using these agents sequentially (never mixed) provides both descaling and disinfection. The importance of this cleaning cannot be overstated -- a dirty humidifier aerosolizes bacteria and mold spores directly into the air you breathe, potentially causing humidifier lung, a form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

## Tips

- Clean your humidifier at least once a week during heavy use. The EPA and CDC both recommend this frequency.
- Use distilled water instead of tap water in your humidifier. This eliminates mineral scale entirely and dramatically reduces cleaning frequency.
- Never mix vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together. Used sequentially they are safe and effective, but combined they form peracetic acid, which is corrosive and can damage your humidifier and irritate your lungs.
- Replace wicks and filters according to the manufacturer's schedule. A dirty filter negates the benefits of a clean tank.
- If you smell a musty or stale odor from the humidifier mist, stop using it immediately and clean it before continuing.
