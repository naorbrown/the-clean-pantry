## Steps

1. Unscrew the aerator from the faucet tip by turning it clockwise (when viewed from below). If it is stuck, wrap a rubber band around it for grip, or use pliers with a cloth to protect the finish.
2. Note the order of the internal parts as you remove them. A typical aerator has an outer housing, a mixer disc with small holes, a flow restrictor, a rubber washer, and a mesh screen. Lay them out in order on a towel.
3. Place all the parts in a small bowl and cover with white vinegar.
4. Let the parts soak for 30-60 minutes. For heavy buildup, soak for up to 2 hours.
5. Remove each piece and scrub with an old toothbrush to dislodge softened mineral deposits.
6. For any holes in the mixer disc that remain clogged, carefully push through with a sewing needle or safety pin to clear the opening.
7. Rinse all parts under running water to flush away loosened debris.
8. Reassemble the aerator in the correct order and screw it back onto the faucet. Turn on the water to test flow and check for leaks.

## Why It Works

Faucet aerators mix air into the water stream to reduce splash and conserve water. The tiny holes in the mixer disc and the fine mesh screen are designed to break the water into small streams, but these same small openings are highly susceptible to mineral clogging. Hard water deposits (primarily calcium carbonate) accumulate gradually, restricting flow and causing the faucet to spray unevenly. White vinegar (5% acetic acid) dissolves calcium carbonate through an acid-base reaction, converting the insoluble mineral into water-soluble calcium acetate that rinses away. The extended soak time allows the acid to penetrate thick deposits. The mechanical scrubbing and needle clearing address any deposits that the acid alone cannot fully dissolve, particularly hardened silica-based minerals that are acid-resistant.

## Tips

- Clean faucet aerators every 3-6 months as preventive maintenance. In homes with very hard water, monthly cleaning keeps flow consistent.
- Take a photo of the disassembled parts before cleaning. The correct reassembly order matters -- a backwards flow restrictor or misaligned washer causes leaking or poor performance.
- If the rubber washer (O-ring) is cracked or brittle, replace it. Hardware stores sell universal aerator repair kits for a few dollars.
- A clogged aerator is the most common cause of low water pressure at a single faucet. Before calling a plumber, clean the aerator first.
- This same technique works on handheld shower head filters and refrigerator water dispenser screens.
