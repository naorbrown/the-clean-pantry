## Steps

1. Unscrew the aerator by turning clockwise (from below). Use a rubber band for grip if stuck.
2. Note the order of internal parts: housing, mixer disc, flow restrictor, washer, mesh screen. Lay them out on a towel.
3. Place all parts in a small bowl and cover with white vinegar.
4. Soak 30-60 minutes. For heavy buildup, soak up to 2 hours.
5. Scrub each piece with an old toothbrush.
6. Push a needle through any clogged holes in the mixer disc.
7. Rinse all parts under running water.
8. Reassemble in the correct order and screw back onto the faucet.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid dissolves calcium carbonate deposits that clog the tiny holes in the mixer disc and mesh screen. Extended soaking penetrates thick deposits. Mechanical scrubbing addresses acid-resistant silica minerals.

## Tips

- Clean aerators every 3-6 months. Monthly in very hard water areas.
- Take a photo of disassembled parts before cleaning — reassembly order matters.
- Replace the rubber washer if cracked or brittle. Hardware stores sell universal kits.
- This same technique works on shower head filters and fridge dispenser screens.
