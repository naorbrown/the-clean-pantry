## Steps

1. Unplug the water dispenser and remove the water bottle or disconnect from the water line.
2. Drain all remaining water from the reservoir through the spigot into a bucket or sink.
3. Mix 3 cups of white vinegar with enough warm water to fill the reservoir. Pour the solution into the reservoir through the top opening.
4. Let the vinegar solution sit in the reservoir for 15-20 minutes. During this time, dispense about 1 cup through each spigot to clean the internal tubing.
5. Drain the vinegar solution completely through the spigots.
6. Pour 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide mixed with warm water into the reservoir. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then drain through the spigots.
7. Fill the reservoir with clean water and add 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Run all the water through the spigots to neutralize and flush any remaining cleaning solution.
8. Repeat the plain water flush one more time. Wipe the exterior, drip tray, and spigot area with a clean damp cloth.

## Why It Works

Water dispensers are a prime location for biofilm growth because they provide a dark, moist environment with a constant nutrient supply from trace minerals in the water. The internal reservoir and tubing are never fully emptied during normal use, creating stagnant zones where bacteria (including Pseudomonas and Legionella species) and mold can colonize. The vinegar step dissolves mineral deposits and creates an acidic environment that kills most bacteria. The hydrogen peroxide step is a powerful oxidizer that destroys mold spores and disrupts biofilm structures that vinegar alone cannot penetrate. Using them sequentially (never mixed) provides complementary disinfection. The baking soda flush at the end neutralizes residual acid, eliminating any taste carryover. The two-stage approach is more effective than either chemical alone.

## Tips

- Clean your water dispenser every 6-8 weeks. If multiple people use it, clean more frequently.
- Between deep cleans, wipe the spigot area daily with a damp cloth. The spigot is the most contaminated part because it is constantly exposed to air and touched by hands.
- If the water starts tasting off or you see pink or green discoloration anywhere inside, clean immediately.
- For countertop dispensers with removable parts, wash the drip tray and baffle in warm soapy water each week.
- After cleaning, run the first glass of water down the drain before drinking to ensure all cleaning residue is flushed.
