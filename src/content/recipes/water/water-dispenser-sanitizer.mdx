## Steps

1. Unplug the dispenser and remove the water bottle or disconnect from the water line.
2. Drain all remaining water through the spigot.
3. Mix 3 cups vinegar with warm water and pour into the reservoir.
4. Let sit 15-20 minutes. Dispense about 1 cup through each spigot to clean the tubing.
5. Drain the vinegar solution completely through the spigots.
6. Pour 1 cup hydrogen peroxide mixed with warm water into the reservoir. Let sit 10 minutes. Drain through spigots.
7. Fill with clean water and 1 tablespoon baking soda. Run all water through the spigots.
8. Flush once more with plain water. Wipe exterior, drip tray, and spigots with a damp cloth.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and kills most bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide destroys mold spores and disrupts biofilm that vinegar alone cannot penetrate. Baking soda neutralizes residual acid and eliminates taste carryover.

## Tips

- Clean every 6-8 weeks. More frequently if multiple people use it.
- Wipe the spigot area daily — it is the most contaminated part.
- Pink or green discoloration inside means clean immediately.
- Run the first glass down the drain after cleaning to flush residue.
