## Steps

1. Empty used grounds and remove the filter.
2. Mix 4 cups white vinegar with 4 cups water and pour into the reservoir.
3. Place the empty carafe on the warming plate.
4. Start a brew cycle. Halfway through, turn off the machine and let it sit 15 minutes.
5. Turn back on and let the remaining solution brew through.
6. Pour out the vinegar solution.
7. Run 3 full cycles with plain fresh water to flush all vinegar.
8. Wash the carafe with warm water and 1 tablespoon baking soda. Wipe the exterior with a damp cloth.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid dissolves calcium carbonate scale that builds up inside heating elements and tubing. The mid-cycle pause gives hot vinegar extended contact time where scale is thickest.

## Tips

- Descale every 1-3 months depending on water hardness.
- For single-serve machines, run brew cycles without a pod until the reservoir empties, then 3 plain water cycles.
- Soak reusable metal filters separately in vinegar for 30 minutes.
- Filtered or distilled water for daily brewing reduces scale dramatically.
