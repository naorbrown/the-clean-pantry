## Steps

1. Empty the coffee maker of any used grounds and remove the paper or reusable filter.
2. Mix 4 cups of white vinegar with 4 cups of water and pour the solution into the water reservoir.
3. Place the empty carafe on the warming plate as if you were brewing a normal pot.
4. Start a brew cycle. Halfway through (when about half the solution has brewed through), turn off the coffee maker and let it sit for 15 minutes. This pause lets the vinegar work on the internal heating element and tubing where scale is thickest.
5. Turn the coffee maker back on and let the remaining solution finish brewing through.
6. Pour out the vinegar solution from the carafe.
7. Fill the reservoir with plain fresh water and run a complete brew cycle. Repeat this plain water rinse cycle 2 more times (3 total rinse cycles) to flush all vinegar from the system.
8. Wash the carafe with warm water and 1 tablespoon of baking soda to neutralize any lingering vinegar residue. Wipe the exterior and warming plate with a damp cloth.

## Why It Works

Coffee makers heat water to 195-205 degrees F and push it through narrow tubes and a small showerhead that distributes water over the grounds. This high temperature, combined with the dissolved minerals in tap water, causes rapid calcium carbonate buildup inside the machine. Scale narrows the internal tubing, reduces water flow, lowers brewing temperature (because the heating element works harder to heat through the insulating scale layer), and ultimately ruins the flavor of your coffee. White vinegar dissolves this scale through the same acid-base reaction used in all descaling -- acetic acid converts insoluble calcium carbonate into soluble calcium acetate. The mid-cycle pause is the key technique: it allows the hot vinegar solution to sit in the internal reservoir and tubing where scale is most concentrated, rather than just flowing through quickly.

## Tips

- Descale every 1-3 months depending on your water hardness. If your coffee starts tasting bitter or the brew time has increased noticeably, it is overdue.
- For single-serve machines (like Keurig), fill the reservoir with the vinegar solution and run brew cycles without a pod until the reservoir is empty. Then run 3 plain water cycles.
- The baking soda carafe wash is important. Coffee oil residue builds up on glass carafes and turns rancid over time, creating a stale flavor that transfers to every pot.
- If you use a reusable metal filter, soak it in the vinegar solution for 30 minutes separately. Coffee oils clog the mesh over time.
- Consider using filtered or distilled water for brewing. It produces better-tasting coffee and dramatically reduces the rate of scale buildup.
