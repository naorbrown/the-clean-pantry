## Steps

1. Remove the bottom dish rack from the dishwasher to access the spray arms and drain area.
2. If the lower spray arm is removable (most twist off or unclip), remove it. Hold it under running water and use a toothpick to clear each spray hole of mineral deposits.
3. Check the drain area at the bottom of the dishwasher. Remove any debris, food particles, or visible buildup. Wipe the area with a damp cloth.
4. If using citric acid, sprinkle 2 tablespoons directly onto the floor of the empty dishwasher.
5. Place a dishwasher-safe cup or bowl upright on the top rack. Pour 2 cups of white vinegar into the cup.
6. Run the dishwasher on the hottest, longest cycle with no detergent and no dishes. The vinegar will gradually spill over and distribute throughout the wash cycle.
7. Once the cycle completes, open the door and sprinkle 1/2 cup of baking soda across the floor of the dishwasher.
8. Run a short hot rinse cycle. The baking soda neutralizes remaining acid and provides a final deodorizing pass.

## Why It Works

Dishwashers circulate hard water at high temperatures, which accelerates mineral deposition. As water heats, dissolved calcium bicarbonate decomposes into insoluble calcium carbonate, which deposits on spray arm nozzles, water inlet valves, and internal plumbing. The vinegar provides acetic acid that dissolves this calcium carbonate scale. The citric acid (if used) is a stronger organic acid that targets more stubborn mineral deposits, particularly those containing iron or manganese that give dishwasher interiors a rust-colored tint. Running a full hot cycle ensures the acid solution reaches every water path in the machine, including the pump, spray arms, and drain line. The baking soda follow-up cycle neutralizes residual acid (preventing any potential long-term corrosion of rubber seals) and addresses any organic odors from trapped food particles in the drain area.

## Tips

- Run this flush every 1-2 months, or whenever you notice white film on glasses, reduced spray arm spin, or a musty smell when you open the dishwasher.
- Clear the spray arm holes before the vinegar cycle. Clogged nozzles reduce the effectiveness of the flush because the vinegar solution cannot reach all internal surfaces.
- Never use bleach and vinegar in the same cycle. The combination produces chlorine gas.
- If your dishwasher has a stainless steel interior, this treatment is safe. For older models with enamel interiors, reduce the citric acid to 1 tablespoon.
- After the flush, the dishwasher door seal (gasket) may still have buildup. Wipe it down separately with a vinegar-dampened cloth.
