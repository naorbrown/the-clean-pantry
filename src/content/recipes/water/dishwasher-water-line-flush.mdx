## Steps

1. Remove the bottom dish rack.
2. If removable, twist off the lower spray arm. Clear each spray hole with a toothpick under running water.
3. Remove debris from the drain area and wipe clean.
4. If using citric acid, sprinkle 2 tablespoons on the dishwasher floor.
5. Place a cup of 2 cups white vinegar upright on the top rack.
6. Run the hottest, longest cycle with no detergent and no dishes.
7. Sprinkle 1/2 cup baking soda across the floor.
8. Run a short hot rinse cycle.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves calcium carbonate scale from spray nozzles, valves, and plumbing. Citric acid targets stubborn iron and manganese deposits. The baking soda cycle neutralizes residual acid and deodorizes.

## Tips

- Clear spray arm holes before the vinegar cycle for maximum effectiveness.
- Never combine bleach and vinegar — produces chlorine gas.
- For enamel interiors, reduce citric acid to 1 tablespoon.
- Wipe the door seal separately with a vinegar-dampened cloth after the flush.
