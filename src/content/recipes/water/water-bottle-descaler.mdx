## Steps

1. Rinse the water bottle with warm water and pour out any remaining liquid.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the bottle. Let it fizz for 30 seconds -- this initial reaction loosens surface grime.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of uncooked rice and 1 cup of warm water.
4. Cap the bottle securely and shake vigorously for 30-45 seconds. The rice grains act as tiny scrub brushes, scouring the interior walls where a bottle brush cannot easily reach.
5. Let the mixture sit for 15-20 minutes to dissolve mineral deposits.
6. Shake vigorously again for another 15 seconds.
7. Pour out the contents and use a bottle brush to scrub any remaining residue, particularly around the bottom and the thread area where the cap screws on.
8. Rinse the bottle at least 3 times with clean water. Air dry upside down with the cap off.

## Why It Works

Reusable water bottles develop three types of buildup: mineral scale from hard water, biofilm from bacteria that feed on saliva and backwash, and odor from trapped organic compounds. The vinegar dissolves mineral scale through acid-base chemistry, while the baking soda provides alkaline cleaning power for organic residue and neutralizes odor. The rice grains serve as a physical abrasive that can reach areas a bottle brush cannot -- the curved bottom of a bottle, narrow necks, and textured interior surfaces. When shaken, the angular rice grains scrape against the walls at multiple angles, dislodging biofilm that is firmly attached to the surface. The combination of chemical dissolution (vinegar), alkaline cleaning (baking soda), and mechanical abrasion (rice) addresses all three types of contamination in a single treatment.

## Tips

- Clean your water bottle daily with soap and water, and do this deep descaling treatment once a month.
- Stainless steel bottles are safe for this treatment. For bottles with narrow necks that a brush cannot reach, the rice method is especially valuable.
- Do not use this on bottles with insulated walls that have become compromised (dents or cracks). Liquid trapped in the insulation void can cause mold.
- The cap and seal are often dirtier than the bottle itself. Soak the cap separately in a cup of vinegar water for 15 minutes and scrub the seal groove with an old toothbrush.
- For extreme odor (like bottles that held milk or smoothies), fill with baking soda and warm water overnight before the vinegar treatment.
