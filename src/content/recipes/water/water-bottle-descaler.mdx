## Steps

1. Rinse the bottle with warm water and pour out any remaining liquid.
2. Add 1 tablespoon baking soda and 1/2 cup vinegar. Let fizz 30 seconds.
3. Add 2 tablespoons uncooked rice and 1 cup warm water.
4. Cap securely and shake vigorously for 30-45 seconds.
5. Let sit 15-20 minutes.
6. Shake again for 15 seconds.
7. Pour out and scrub remaining residue with a bottle brush, especially the bottom and cap threads.
8. Rinse at least 3 times. Air dry upside down with cap off.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves mineral scale. Baking soda neutralizes odor from organic compounds. Rice grains act as a physical abrasive that reaches curved bottoms and narrow necks a brush cannot.

## Tips

- Soak the cap separately in vinegar water for 15 minutes. Scrub the seal groove with a toothbrush.
- Do not use on insulated bottles with dents or cracks — liquid trapped in the void causes mold.
- For extreme odor from milk or smoothies, fill with baking soda and warm water overnight before the vinegar treatment.
