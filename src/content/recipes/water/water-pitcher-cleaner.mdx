## Steps

1. Remove the filter cartridge and lid. Set the filter aside on a clean towel.
2. Empty any remaining water.
3. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons baking soda into the pitcher. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Let fizz 30 seconds.
4. Add 1 cup vinegar and 3 cups warm water. Swirl gently.
5. Soak 15-20 minutes. Extend to 30 for visible slime.
6. Scrub inside walls, bottom, reservoir, corners, and spout with a bottle brush.
7. Rinse at least 3 times with clean water.
8. Dry with a cloth or air dry completely before reassembling.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves mineral scale from calcium and magnesium. Baking soda and lemon juice create effervescence that lifts biofilm from plastic surfaces. The acid environment kills Serratia marcescens and other bacteria that cause pink slime.

## Tips

- Never soak the filter cartridge — vinegar degrades activated carbon and ion exchange resins.
- Clean the lid and reservoir insert too. Biofilm grows on all wet surfaces.
- Store with the lid slightly ajar when not in use to allow air circulation and prevent mold.
