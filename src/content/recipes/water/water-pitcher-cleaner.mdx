## Steps

1. Remove the filter cartridge and lid from the water pitcher. Set the filter aside on a clean towel -- do not soak it in the cleaning solution.
2. Empty any remaining water from the pitcher.
3. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the bottom of the pitcher. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Let the mixture fizz for 30 seconds.
4. Add 1 cup of white vinegar and 3 cups of warm water to the pitcher. Swirl gently to combine.
5. Let the solution soak for 15-20 minutes. For visible slime or discoloration, extend to 30 minutes.
6. Use a bottle brush to scrub the inside walls, the bottom, and especially the reservoir area where water sits. Pay attention to the corners and the spout area.
7. Rinse the pitcher thoroughly with clean water at least 3 times to remove all vinegar residue.
8. Dry with a clean cloth or let it air dry completely before reassembling with the filter.

## Why It Works

The pink or orange slime that develops inside water pitchers is a biofilm produced by Serratia marcescens and other airborne bacteria that thrive in moist environments. The white cloudy film on the inside walls is mineral scale from dissolved calcium and magnesium in tap water. This cleaning solution addresses both problems simultaneously. The acetic acid in vinegar dissolves the mineral scale, while the slightly alkaline baking soda and acidic lemon juice create a mild effervescence that physically lifts the biofilm from the plastic surface. Together, the acid environment makes the pitcher inhospitable to the bacteria, and the mechanical scrubbing removes the biofilm matrix that protects bacterial colonies from simple rinsing. Regular cleaning prevents the biofilm from re-establishing its protective structure.

## Tips

- Clean your water pitcher every 1-2 weeks, regardless of whether you see visible slime. Biofilm can be present before it becomes visible.
- Never put the filter cartridge in the cleaning solution. Vinegar degrades the activated carbon and ion exchange resins inside the filter.
- If your pitcher has a plastic taste after cleaning, rinse it one more time with plain water and let it air out for an hour.
- The lid and reservoir insert should be cleaned with the same solution. Biofilm grows on all wet surfaces, not just the pitcher body.
- Store the pitcher with the lid slightly ajar when not in use for extended periods. This allows air circulation and prevents mold growth.
