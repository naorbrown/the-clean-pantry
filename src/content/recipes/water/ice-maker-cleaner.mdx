## Steps

1. Turn off the ice maker using the on/off switch or lever arm. Unplug the refrigerator or turn off the water supply line to the ice maker.
2. Remove all existing ice from the ice bin and discard it. Remove the ice bin from the freezer.
3. Wash the ice bin in the sink with warm water and 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Scrub with a clean sponge, paying attention to corners and the bottom. Rinse thoroughly and set aside to dry.
4. Mix 2 cups of white vinegar with 2 cups of warm water in a bowl.
5. Dip a clean sponge into the vinegar solution and wipe down the ice maker mechanism inside the freezer, including the ice mold tray, water fill tube, and any accessible surfaces. Wring the sponge and repeat until all visible scale or discoloration is removed.
6. For the water fill tube, dip a small brush or pipe cleaner in the vinegar solution and gently clean inside the tube opening.
7. Wipe all cleaned surfaces with a sponge dampened with plain water to remove vinegar residue. Dry with a clean towel.
8. Replace the ice bin, restore power, and turn the ice maker back on. Discard the first 2-3 batches of ice to flush any remaining vinegar from the system.

## Why It Works

Refrigerator ice makers are subject to two forms of contamination: mineral scale from hard water and biofilm from airborne bacteria and mold that enter the moist, dark freezer environment. The mineral scale appears as white or off-white deposits on the ice mold and fill tube, and can cause ice to taste stale or chalky. The biofilm manifests as a slimy film, sometimes pink or gray, on surfaces that stay moist. White vinegar dissolves mineral scale through acid-base chemistry, converting insoluble calcium carbonate into soluble calcium acetate. The acetic acid also lowers the surface pH below the threshold where most bacteria and mold can survive. Baking soda in the ice bin wash provides gentle abrasion and pH neutralization, removing odors that the bin absorbs from the freezer over time.

## Tips

- Clean your ice maker every 3-6 months, or immediately if ice starts tasting off, looking cloudy, or coming out smaller than normal.
- Cloudy or white ice is a sign of mineral-heavy water. Consider installing an inline water filter on the ice maker supply line.
- Never use bleach inside an ice maker. The residual taste is extremely difficult to flush completely, and bleach can damage rubber seals.
- If your ice has an odor, the problem is often the ice bin rather than the ice maker itself. Plastic bins absorb freezer odors over time.
- After cleaning, label the calendar with the next cleaning date. Most people forget about the ice maker entirely until there is a problem.
