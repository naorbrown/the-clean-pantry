## Steps

1. Turn off the ice maker and unplug the refrigerator or shut off the water supply.
2. Remove and discard all existing ice. Remove the ice bin.
3. Wash the bin with warm water and 2 tablespoons baking soda. Scrub corners and bottom.
4. Mix 2 cups vinegar with 2 cups warm water.
5. Wipe the ice maker mechanism with a sponge dipped in the solution: ice mold, fill tube, and accessible surfaces.
6. Clean inside the fill tube opening with a small brush or pipe cleaner dipped in the solution.
7. Wipe all surfaces again with plain water. Dry with a towel.
8. Replace the bin, restore power, and discard the first 2-3 batches of ice.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves mineral scale and lowers surface pH below the threshold where bacteria and mold survive. Baking soda provides gentle abrasion and neutralizes odors the plastic bin absorbs from the freezer.

## Tips

- Clean every 3-6 months, or when ice tastes off, looks cloudy, or comes out smaller than normal.
- Cloudy ice signals mineral-heavy water — consider an inline water filter.
- Never use bleach inside an ice maker. The taste is nearly impossible to flush.
- Odor often comes from the bin, not the maker. Plastic absorbs freezer odors over time.
