## Steps

1. Fill the kettle halfway with water.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of citric acid (or 1 cup white vinegar).
3. Bring to a full boil.
4. Turn off heat and let sit 15-20 minutes.
5. If scale remains, repeat the boil-and-soak.
6. Wipe the interior with a soft sponge to remove loosened flakes.
7. Rinse at least 3 times with clean water.
8. Boil once with fresh water and discard to clear any residual taste.

## Why It Works

Citric acid is triprotic — it donates three hydrogen ions per molecule, making it highly effective at dissolving calcium carbonate. The reaction produces water-soluble calcium citrate and CO2. Citric acid is preferred over vinegar for kettles because it is odorless and tasteless.

## Tips

- Citric acid powder is in the canning section of grocery stores. Shelf-stable for years.
- For electric kettles with concealed elements, this is the only safe cleaning method.
- Descale monthly in hard water areas.
- Empty the kettle after each use — standing water deposits more scale.
- Lemon juice works in a pinch but requires about 1/4 cup to match 2 tablespoons of powder.
