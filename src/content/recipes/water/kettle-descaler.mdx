## Steps

1. Fill the kettle halfway with water.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of citric acid (or 1 cup of white vinegar if using the alternative).
3. Bring the solution to a full boil. For electric kettles, let it complete its auto-shutoff cycle. For stovetop kettles, boil for 1-2 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat and let the solution sit in the kettle for 15-20 minutes. You will see the limescale dissolving -- the solution may turn slightly cloudy.
5. Pour out the solution and inspect the interior. If significant scale remains, repeat the boil-and-soak process once more.
6. Wipe the interior with a soft sponge to remove any loosened scale flakes. Do not use abrasive scrubbers on stainless steel or glass kettles.
7. Rinse the kettle thoroughly with clean water at least 3 times.
8. Fill the kettle with fresh water, boil once, and discard the water. This final boil ensures no citric acid taste remains.

## Why It Works

Limescale in kettles is almost entirely calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposited as hard water is repeatedly heated. The high temperature of boiling accelerates the precipitation process, which is why kettles scale up faster than any other water appliance. Citric acid is a triprotic acid (it can donate three hydrogen ions per molecule), making it particularly effective at dissolving calcium carbonate. The reaction produces calcium citrate (which is water-soluble), water, and carbon dioxide gas -- the bubbling you see during the soak. Citric acid is preferred over vinegar for kettles because it is odorless and tasteless at the concentrations used, whereas acetic acid leaves a persistent vinegar smell that requires multiple rinse cycles to clear. Boiling the acid solution ensures it reaches every surface inside the kettle, including the heating element coil or plate where scale tends to be thickest.

## Tips

- Citric acid powder is available in the canning section of grocery stores or online. It is inexpensive and shelf-stable for years.
- For electric kettles with concealed heating elements, this is the only safe cleaning method. Never scrape the bottom plate.
- Descale monthly in hard water areas, or whenever you see white flakes in your tea or coffee.
- Between descaling sessions, empty the kettle after each use rather than leaving water sitting in it. Standing water deposits more scale.
- Lemon juice works in a pinch (it contains citric acid), but you need about 1/4 cup of juice to match the potency of 2 tablespoons of powder.
