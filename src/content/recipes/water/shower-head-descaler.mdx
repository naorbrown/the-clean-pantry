## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of white vinegar into a gallon-size plastic bag.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda to the vinegar. It will fizz vigorously -- let the fizzing subside before the next step.
3. Lift the bag up and over the shower head so the head is fully submerged in the vinegar solution.
4. Secure the bag around the shower neck with a rubber band or twist tie. Make sure the bag is tight enough that the shower head stays submerged.
5. Leave the bag in place for 6-8 hours or overnight. For heavy buildup, a full 12 hours is more effective.
6. Remove the bag and pour the vinegar down the drain.
7. Turn the shower on to full hot water for 2-3 minutes to flush loosened deposits from inside the head.
8. Use an old toothbrush to scrub around the individual nozzle holes, dislodging any remaining mineral flakes. Run the water again to flush.

## Why It Works

Hard water contains dissolved calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. As water evaporates from the shower head nozzles between uses, these minerals are left behind as solid deposits that gradually narrow and block the openings. White vinegar (5% acetic acid) dissolves calcium carbonate through an acid-base reaction: CaCO3 + 2CH3COOH produces Ca(CH3COO)2 + H2O + CO2. The calcium acetate produced is water-soluble and flushes away. The initial baking soda fizz helps physically loosen surface deposits, but the primary descaling happens during the extended soak as the acetic acid slowly dissolves the mineral layer. The overnight duration is necessary because the acid must penetrate through thick deposits layer by layer.

## Tips

- If your shower head has a chrome finish, this method is safe. Avoid it on specialty finishes like brushed gold or oil-rubbed bronze.
- For a removable shower head, unscrew it and soak it in a bowl of vinegar instead. This allows you to shake out loosened deposits more effectively.
- If the water pressure does not improve after one treatment, repeat the soak. Severe buildup from very hard water may need 2-3 treatments.
- As a preventive measure, wipe the shower head dry after each use. Mineral deposits only form when water evaporates on the surface.
- Use this same technique on kitchen faucet aerators and bathroom faucet heads.
