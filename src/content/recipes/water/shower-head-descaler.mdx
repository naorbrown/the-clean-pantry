## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of white vinegar into a gallon-size plastic bag.
2. Add 1 tablespoon baking soda. Let the fizzing subside.
3. Lift the bag over the shower head so it is fully submerged.
4. Secure with a rubber band or twist tie.
5. Leave 6-8 hours or overnight. 12 hours for heavy buildup.
6. Remove the bag and pour vinegar down the drain.
7. Run hot water for 2-3 minutes to flush loosened deposits.
8. Scrub nozzle holes with an old toothbrush. Run water again to flush.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid converts insoluble calcium carbonate into water-soluble calcium acetate. The baking soda fizz loosens surface deposits. The overnight soak allows acid to penetrate thick mineral layers.

## Tips

- Safe on chrome. Avoid on brushed gold or oil-rubbed bronze.
- For removable heads, unscrew and soak in a bowl for easier cleaning.
- Repeat if pressure does not improve after one treatment.
- Wipe the head dry after each use to prevent future deposits.
