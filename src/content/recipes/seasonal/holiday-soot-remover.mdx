## Steps

1. Ensure the fireplace is completely cold. Remove loose ash with a shovel and vacuum remaining dust with a shop vacuum.
2. Lay drop cloths on the floor in front of the fireplace.
3. Combine 1/4 cup cream of tartar and 1/4 cup baking soda in a bowl.
4. Add 1 tablespoon of dish soap, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide. Stir as the mixture fizzes into a thick paste. Add warm water one tablespoon at a time until spreadable but not runny.
5. Spread the paste onto soot-stained bricks or stone in 2-foot sections, about 1/8 inch thick.
6. Let the paste sit for 30 minutes. For heavy buildup, cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying.
7. Scrub with a stiff nylon brush using firm circular motions.
8. Rinse with a sponge dipped in clean warm water, wringing frequently. Repeat until no residue remains.

## Why It Works

Cream of tartar is a mild acid that loosens the bond between soot and masonry without etching brick the way stronger acids do.

Baking soda provides alkaline abrasion that lifts carbon particles from textured brick. The acid-base reaction pushes cleaning agents into the pores of the brick.

Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the tar compounds in soot, converting dark carbon chains into colorless, water-soluble molecules.

## Tips

- **For glass fireplace doors.** Dip a damp cloth in plain ash and rub the glass in circular motions — the ash polishes soot off glass without scratching.
- **White mortar stains.** Wipe residue with a cloth dampened with equal parts vinegar and water.
- **Prevent buildup.** Burn only seasoned hardwood — green or softwood produces far more soot.
- **Annual deep clean.** Clean the firebox at the start and end of each heating season.
