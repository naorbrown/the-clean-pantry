## Steps

1. Ensure the fireplace is completely cold and remove all loose ash using a fireplace shovel and dustpan. Vacuum remaining fine ash with a shop vacuum.
2. Lay drop cloths on the floor in front of the fireplace to protect flooring from drips.
3. Combine 1/4 cup cream of tartar and 1/4 cup baking soda in a bowl. Stir to blend the dry ingredients evenly.
4. Add 1 tablespoon of dish soap, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide. Stir as the mixture fizzes and settles into a thick paste. Add warm water one tablespoon at a time until the paste is spreadable but not runny.
5. Using a stiff-bristled brush or old paintbrush, spread the paste onto soot-stained bricks or stone. Work in small sections about 2 feet square, applying a layer approximately 1/8 inch thick.
6. Let the paste sit for 30 minutes. For heavy soot buildup, cover the paste with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out and extend the contact time.
7. Scrub the paste with a stiff nylon brush using firm circular motions. The soot will lift into the paste, turning it dark gray or black.
8. Rinse the area with a sponge dipped in clean warm water, wringing frequently. Repeat rinsing until no residue remains. Allow the brick to air dry completely.

## Why It Works

Soot is composed of fine carbon particles bound together by sticky tar residues. Cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) is a mild acid that dissolves the mineral deposits in brick while loosening the bond between soot particles and the masonry surface. It is gentle enough to use on brick without causing the etching that stronger acids produce.

Baking soda provides mild alkaline abrasion that physically lifts carbon particles from the textured brick surface. The combination of an acid (cream of tartar) and a base (baking soda) creates a controlled effervescent reaction that pushes cleaning agents into the pores of the brick.

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer that breaks down the organic tar compounds in soot, converting dark-colored carbon chains into colorless, water-soluble molecules. This is why heavy soot stains lighten significantly after treatment.

## Tips

- **For glass fireplace doors.** Skip the abrasive paste. Instead, dip a damp cloth in plain ash from the fireplace and rub the glass in circular motions. The fine calcium carbonate in wood ash polishes soot off glass without scratching.
- **White mortar stains.** If the paste leaves a white residue on dark brick, wipe with a cloth dampened with equal parts vinegar and water.
- **Prevent buildup.** Burn only seasoned hardwood. Green or softwood produces far more creosote and soot than properly dried hardwood.
- **Annual deep clean.** Clean the firebox at the start and end of each heating season. Soot left on brick over summer absorbs humidity and becomes much harder to remove.
