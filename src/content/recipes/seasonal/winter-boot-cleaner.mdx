## Steps

1. Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of room temperature water in a small bowl or 8 oz bottle.
2. Add 1/2 teaspoon of clear liquid dish soap and stir gently to combine. The soap helps lift salt residue from the leather grain.
3. Brush off any loose dirt or dried salt from the boots using a soft dry brush or cloth. Removing dry debris first prevents scratching during wet cleaning.
4. Dampen a soft cloth with the vinegar solution. Wring it out so the cloth is moist but not dripping -- excess liquid can damage leather.
5. Wipe the salt-stained areas using gentle circular motions, working from the edges of the stain inward. Re-dampen the cloth as needed. The white salt lines should dissolve and transfer to the cloth.
6. Wipe the entire boot with a clean damp cloth (water only) to remove any vinegar residue. Allow boots to air dry away from direct heat for at least one hour.
7. Once dry, apply a small amount of olive oil to a clean cloth and buff the leather in circular motions. This restores moisture stripped during cleaning and creates a light protective barrier.

## Why It Works

Road salt (sodium chloride and calcium chloride) leaves white crystalline deposits on boots as the salt water wicks up the leather and evaporates. These deposits are alkaline, with a pH around 10. White vinegar (pH 2.4) neutralizes the alkaline salt through an acid-base reaction, dissolving the crystals and converting them into water-soluble sodium acetate that wipes away easily.

The dish soap acts as a surfactant, reducing surface tension so the vinegar solution can penetrate into the leather grain where salt deposits settle. Without soap, the solution tends to bead on the leather surface rather than reaching embedded salt.

Olive oil replaces the natural oils stripped from leather during cleaning. Leather is animal skin that requires oils to stay supple -- without reconditioning after cleaning, leather dries out, cracks, and becomes more porous and susceptible to future salt damage.

## Tips

- **For suede boots.** Use the vinegar solution on a barely damp cloth and blot rather than rub. After drying, brush the suede with a suede brush to restore the nap.
- **Prevent future stains.** Apply a beeswax-based waterproofing treatment after cleaning. This creates a hydrophobic barrier that prevents salt water from penetrating the leather.
- **Act fast.** Salt stains are easiest to remove when fresh. If left for weeks, the salt can permanently discolor leather by drawing out tanning agents.
- **Avoid heat drying.** Never place wet boots near a radiator or use a hair dryer. Rapid heat causes leather to shrink, crack, and lose its shape.
