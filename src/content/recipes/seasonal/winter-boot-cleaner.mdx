## Steps

1. Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1/2 cup of room temperature water in a small bowl or 8 oz bottle.
2. Add 1/2 teaspoon of clear liquid dish soap and stir gently.
3. Brush off loose dirt or dried salt with a soft dry brush or cloth.
4. Dampen a soft cloth with the vinegar solution. Wring until moist but not dripping.
5. Wipe salt-stained areas using gentle circular motions, working from the edges inward.
6. Wipe the entire boot with a clean damp cloth (water only). Air dry away from direct heat for at least one hour.
7. Apply a small amount of olive oil to a clean cloth and buff the leather in circular motions.

## Why It Works

Road salt leaves alkaline crystalline deposits as salt water wicks up leather and evaporates. Vinegar neutralizes the alkaline salt, converting it into water-soluble compounds that wipe away easily.

Dish soap reduces surface tension so the solution penetrates into the leather grain where salt embeds, rather than beading on the surface.

Olive oil replaces natural oils stripped during cleaning, keeping leather supple and less porous against future salt damage.

## Tips

- **For suede boots.** Blot rather than rub with a barely damp cloth. Brush with a suede brush after drying.
- **Prevent future stains.** Apply a beeswax-based waterproofing treatment after cleaning.
- **Act fast.** Fresh salt stains come out easily; old ones can permanently discolor leather.
- **Avoid heat drying.** Never use a radiator or hair dryer — rapid heat cracks and shrinks leather.
