## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a clean 32 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 cups of distilled water and 1/2 cup of rubbing alcohol.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap.
4. Add 15 drops of lavender essential oil and 10 drops of orange essential oil. Cap and shake gently.
5. Start in the kitchen. Spray countertops, cabinet fronts, appliance surfaces, and the stovetop. Wipe with a microfiber cloth, flipping frequently.
6. Move to bathrooms. Spray mirrors, counters, faucets, tile walls, and the toilet exterior. Let sit 2-3 minutes on soap scum before wiping.
7. In living areas, spray and wipe light switches, door handles, baseboards, windowsills, and ceiling fan blades.
8. Finish with entryway surfaces: shoe racks, coat hooks, front door handles, and the mail table.

## Why It Works

White vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and kills bacteria. Rubbing alcohol cuts oily residue and evaporates quickly for streak-free results. Castile soap emulsifies grease into tiny droplets that rinse away.

Orange oil is a natural solvent that dissolves sticky residues like label adhesive, candle wax drips, and holiday decoration film. Lavender oil adds antibacterial action that complements the vinegar.

## Tips

- **Work top to bottom.** Start with ceiling fans and high shelves — dust and drips fall.
- **Dedicate cloths by room.** Separate microfiber cloths for kitchen, bathroom, and living areas prevent cross-contamination.
- **Do not forget vents.** Spray onto a cloth (not into the vent) and wipe HVAC register covers.
- **Make it a ritual.** Label the bottle with the date so you know to make a fresh batch next year.
