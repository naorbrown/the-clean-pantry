## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a clean 32 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 cups of distilled water and 1/2 cup of rubbing alcohol. The alcohol increases the cleaning power and speeds evaporation for streak-free results on glass and mirrors.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap. This provides the surfactant action needed to cut through kitchen grease and bathroom soap scum.
4. Add 15 drops of lavender essential oil and 10 drops of orange essential oil. Cap the bottle and shake gently to combine.
5. Start your deep clean in the kitchen. Spray countertops, cabinet fronts, appliance surfaces, and the stovetop. Wipe with a microfiber cloth, flipping the cloth frequently to avoid redistributing grime.
6. Move to bathrooms. Spray mirrors, counters, faucets, tile walls, and the exterior of the toilet. Let the spray sit for 2-3 minutes on soap scum before wiping.
7. In living areas and bedrooms, spray and wipe light switches, door handles, baseboards, windowsills, and ceiling fan blades. These are high-touch or dust-collecting surfaces that are often overlooked.
8. Finish with entryway surfaces: shoe racks, coat hooks, front door handles, and the mail table. These areas collect the most outdoor contaminants.

## Why It Works

This spray combines three cleaning mechanisms in one bottle. White vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and kills bacteria through its acetic acid content. Rubbing alcohol cuts through oily residue and evaporates quickly, preventing the streaks and water spots that make freshly cleaned surfaces look dingy. Castile soap emulsifies grease, breaking fat molecules into tiny droplets that rinse away cleanly.

The lavender and orange oils serve a functional purpose beyond fragrance. D-limonene, the primary compound in orange oil, is a natural solvent that dissolves sticky residues like label adhesive, candle wax drips, and the gummy film left by holiday decorations. Linalool in lavender oil has documented antibacterial properties that complement the vinegar's antimicrobial action.

The 32 oz batch size is intentional -- a new year deep clean covering kitchen, bathrooms, and living areas typically uses an entire bottle.

## Tips

- **Work top to bottom.** In every room, start with ceiling fans and high shelves, then work downward. Dust and drips fall, so cleaning high surfaces first avoids re-contaminating lower ones.
- **Dedicate cloths by room.** Use separate microfiber cloths for the kitchen, bathroom, and living areas. This prevents cross-contaminating food surfaces with bathroom bacteria.
- **Do not forget vents.** Spray the solution onto a cloth (not directly into the vent) and wipe HVAC register covers. Dust-caked vents recirculate particles every time the system runs.
- **Make it a ritual.** Mixing a big batch of this spray on January 1st creates a satisfying annual tradition. Label the bottle with the date so you know to make a fresh batch next year.
