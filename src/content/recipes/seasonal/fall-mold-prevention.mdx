## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle using a funnel.
2. Add 1 cup of distilled water. Tap water contains minerals that can reduce the effectiveness of essential oils over time.
3. Add 20 drops of tea tree essential oil. Tea tree oil is the primary antifungal agent in this spray.
4. Add 10 drops of eucalyptus essential oil for additional antimicrobial action and a cleaner scent profile.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol. This helps the essential oils dissolve evenly in the water-vinegar base and speeds surface drying.
6. Cap the bottle and shake vigorously for 15 seconds to emulsify the oils into the liquid.
7. Spray generously on bathroom tile grout, window frames, basement walls, closet corners, and any surface where moisture collects during fall. Do not rinse -- allow the solution to air dry.

## Why It Works

Mold requires three things to grow: moisture, organic material, and a surface to colonize. Fall weather creates the moisture component as cooling temperatures cause condensation on windows, basement walls, and bathroom surfaces. This spray attacks mold at the chemical level.

White vinegar (5% acetic acid) penetrates the cell membranes of mold and mildew, killing approximately 82% of known mold species on contact. Tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound that disrupts the cell membrane integrity of fungal organisms. Studies have shown tea tree oil is effective against aspergillus, penicillium, and cladosporium -- the three most common household mold genera.

The rubbing alcohol serves a dual purpose: it acts as a solvent to keep the essential oils evenly distributed and it accelerates evaporation, reducing the surface moisture that mold needs to grow.

## Tips

- **Shake before every use.** Essential oils separate from water quickly. Always shake the bottle before spraying to ensure even distribution.
- **Apply weekly in problem areas.** Spray bathroom grout, window sills, and basement corners once per week throughout fall to prevent mold before it starts.
- **Do not rinse.** The residual vinegar and tea tree oil continue to inhibit mold growth for several days after application. Rinsing removes this protective layer.
- **Spot test first.** Tea tree oil can stain some porous surfaces. Test on an inconspicuous area before spraying widely.
