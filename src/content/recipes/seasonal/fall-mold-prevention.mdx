## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of distilled water.
3. Add 20 drops of tea tree essential oil.
4. Add 10 drops of eucalyptus essential oil.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol.
6. Cap the bottle and shake vigorously for 15 seconds.
7. Spray generously on bathroom tile grout, window frames, basement walls, closet corners, and any surface where moisture collects. Do not rinse — allow to air dry.

## Why It Works

White vinegar penetrates mold cell membranes and kills most common household species on contact. Tea tree oil disrupts fungal cell membranes and remains active for days after application, providing a lasting antifungal barrier.

Rubbing alcohol keeps the essential oils evenly distributed and speeds evaporation, reducing the surface moisture mold needs to grow.

## Tips

- **Shake before every use.** Essential oils separate from water quickly.
- **Apply weekly in problem areas.** Spray bathroom grout, window sills, and basement corners once per week throughout fall.
- **Spot test first.** Tea tree oil can stain some porous surfaces.
