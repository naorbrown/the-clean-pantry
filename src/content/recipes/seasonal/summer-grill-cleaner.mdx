## Steps

1. Let grill grates cool completely. Remove and place on an old towel or newspaper.
2. Combine 1/2 cup of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of coarse salt in a bowl.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 2 tablespoons of warm water. Stir into a thick paste.
4. Pour 1/4 cup of white vinegar over the paste. Stir immediately as it fizzes.
5. Spread the paste over the grill grates, coating tops and undersides.
6. Let sit for 20 minutes. For heavy buildup, wrap grates in a plastic bag to keep the paste moist.
7. Scrub with a stiff-bristled brush or crumpled aluminum foil.
8. Rinse thoroughly with a garden hose or in clean water. Dry completely to prevent rusting.

## Why It Works

Baking soda saponifies grease, converting fat molecules into water-soluble compounds that release from the metal surface.

The vinegar-baking soda fizzing lifts loosened particles away from the grate, making scrubbing more effective. Coarse salt provides abrasion hard enough to remove carbon but soft enough to avoid scratching steel or cast iron.

## Tips

- **Heat first for heavy buildup.** Heat the grill to high for 10 minutes before removing grates to loosen carbon.
- **Season cast iron after cleaning.** Rub with a thin coat of vegetable oil and heat briefly to prevent rust.
- **Clean the drip pan too.** Mix a thinner version of the paste and pour it in while you scrub the grates.
- **Frequency matters.** Clean after every 3-4 uses to prevent heavy buildup.
