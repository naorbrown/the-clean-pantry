## Steps

1. Allow grill grates to cool completely after your last use. Remove them from the grill and place them on a protected surface like an old towel or newspaper.
2. Combine 1/2 cup of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of coarse salt in a small bowl. The salt provides extra abrasive texture for scrubbing carbonized food.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid dish soap and 2 tablespoons of warm water. Stir until a thick, spreadable paste forms. If the paste is too dry, add water one teaspoon at a time.
4. Pour 1/4 cup of white vinegar over the paste. It will fizz as the acid reacts with the baking soda. Stir immediately to capture the fizzing action in the paste.
5. Spread the paste generously over the grill grates using a brush or gloved hands. Coat both the top bars and the undersides where grease drips collect.
6. Let the paste sit for 20 minutes. For heavy buildup, wrap the grates loosely in a plastic bag to keep the paste moist and extend contact time to 30 minutes.
7. Scrub the grates with a stiff-bristled brush or crumpled aluminum foil. The salt crystals and baking soda work together to abrade carbonized residue without scratching metal.
8. Rinse the grates thoroughly with a garden hose or in a large basin of clean water. Dry completely before returning to the grill to prevent flash rusting on cast iron grates.

## Why It Works

Carbonized grease on grill grates is a polymerized fat layer that resists water and mild cleaners. Baking soda is a mild alkali (pH 8.3) that saponifies grease, meaning it reacts with fat molecules to turn them into a water-soluble soap-like substance. This breaks the bond between the carbonized layer and the metal surface.

The vinegar-baking soda reaction produces carbon dioxide gas. While the fizzing itself does not clean, it physically lifts loosened particles away from the grate surface, making scrubbing more effective. Coarse salt acts as a mechanical abrasive that is hard enough to remove carbon but soft enough to avoid scratching stainless steel or cast iron.

## Tips

- **Heat first for heavy buildup.** For extremely thick carbon deposits, heat the grill to high for 10 minutes before removing the grates. This loosens the bond between carbon and metal before you apply the paste.
- **Season cast iron after cleaning.** If your grates are cast iron, rub them with a thin coat of vegetable oil after cleaning and heat briefly to prevent rust.
- **Clean the drip pan too.** Mix a thinner version of this paste (add more water) and pour it into the drip pan. Let it sit while you scrub the grates, then wipe clean.
- **Frequency matters.** Cleaning grates after every 3-4 uses prevents the heavy buildup that requires extended soaking. A quick scrub with this paste after each cookout keeps grates in top shape.
