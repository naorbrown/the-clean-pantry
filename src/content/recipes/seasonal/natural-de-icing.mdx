## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of rubbing alcohol into a 32 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of warm water.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap.
4. Shake gently to combine. Avoid vigorous shaking.
5. Spray generously over icy walkways, steps, or car windshields.
6. Wait 5-10 minutes. For thick ice (over 1/4 inch), apply a second coat.
7. Scrape loosened ice with a shovel or scraper. Treated surfaces resist refreezing.

## Why It Works

Rubbing alcohol freezes at approximately -128 degrees F. When it contacts ice, it lowers the freezing point of the surface water, melting ice even in sub-freezing conditions — without the chlorides in rock salt that damage concrete and kill plants.

Dish soap reduces surface tension, letting the alcohol spread into cracks in the ice rather than beading on top.

## Alternative

For a dry de-icing option, spread coarse sand or food-grade diatomaceous earth on icy walkways. Neither melts ice, but both provide traction and are completely non-toxic. Sand is easy to sweep up in spring. Avoid cat litter -- it turns into a slippery clay paste when wet and can clog drains.
## Tips

- **Pre-treat before a storm.** Spray walkways the evening before expected freezing rain to prevent ice from bonding.
- **Windshield use.** Spray on, wait 2-3 minutes, and wipe clean. Do not use on cracked windshields.
- **Keep a bottle in your car.** It will not freeze at any winter temperature.
- **Concrete caution.** Avoid repeated heavy application on new concrete (less than one year old).
