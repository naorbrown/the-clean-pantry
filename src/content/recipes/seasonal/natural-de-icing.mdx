## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of rubbing alcohol (70% isopropyl) into a 32 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of warm water.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap. The soap acts as a surfactant to help the solution spread across the ice surface instead of beading up.
4. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake gently to combine. Do not shake vigorously -- you do not want excessive foam.
5. Spray the solution generously over icy walkways, steps, or car windshields. Cover the entire icy area with an even coating.
6. Wait 5-10 minutes. The ice will begin to crack and loosen. For thick ice (over 1/4 inch), you may need a second application.
7. Once the ice has loosened, use a shovel or scraper to remove it. The solution lowers the refreezing point, so treated surfaces stay clear longer than surfaces treated with hot water alone.

## Why It Works

Rubbing alcohol has a freezing point of approximately -128 degrees F, far below any winter temperature you will encounter. When it contacts ice, it lowers the freezing point of the surface water, causing the ice to melt even in sub-freezing conditions. This is the same principle behind commercial de-icers, but without the chlorides that damage concrete and kill plants.

The dish soap reduces surface tension, allowing the alcohol solution to spread into cracks in the ice rather than sitting on top. This increases the contact area and speeds up the melting process.

## Alternative

For a dry de-icing option, spread coarse sand or food-grade diatomaceous earth on icy walkways. Neither melts ice, but both provide traction and are completely non-toxic. Sand is easy to sweep up in spring. Avoid cat litter -- it turns into a slippery clay paste when wet and can clog drains.
## Tips

- **Pre-treat before a storm.** Spray walkways and steps the evening before expected freezing rain or snow. The alcohol residue lowers the freezing point of any moisture that lands on the treated surface, preventing ice from bonding to the concrete.
- **Windshield use.** This solution is safe for car windshields and works faster than a standard ice scraper. Spray it on, wait 2-3 minutes, and the ice will slide off with a single pass of the wipers. Do not use on windshields that have cracks, as the alcohol can seep into the crack.
- **Keep a bottle in your car.** Mix a batch and keep it in the trunk during winter months. It will not freeze at any temperature you are likely to encounter.
- **Concrete caution.** While this solution is gentler than rock salt on concrete, repeated heavy application on new concrete (less than one year old) should be avoided. New concrete is more porous and absorbs liquids more readily.
