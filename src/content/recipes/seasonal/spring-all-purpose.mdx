## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of distilled water.
3. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap.
5. Add 10 drops of lemon essential oil if desired. Cap the bottle tightly.
6. Shake gently to combine.
7. Spray onto countertops, appliances, cabinet fronts, or tile and wipe with a microfiber cloth.

## Why It Works

Acetic acid in vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and cuts grease. Lemon juice adds citric acid, which is particularly effective at dissolving hard water stains and soap scum.

Castile soap reduces surface tension so the solution spreads across surfaces and penetrates grease rather than beading on top.

## Tips

- **Infuse for extra power.** Soak citrus peels in vinegar for two weeks, then strain. Use in place of plain vinegar.
- **Avoid mixing with bleach.** Vinegar plus bleach creates toxic chlorine gas.
- **Streak-free glass.** For windows and mirrors, skip the castile soap — it can leave a slight film on glass.
- **Shelf life.** Stays effective for about one month. Make fresh batches for best results.
