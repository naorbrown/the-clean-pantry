## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle using a funnel.
2. Add 1 cup of distilled water. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on glass and mirrors.
3. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. The citric acid boosts the cleaning power of the vinegar and adds a fresh scent.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap. This acts as a surfactant to lift grease and grime from surfaces.
5. Add 10 drops of lemon essential oil if desired for extra fragrance. Cap the bottle tightly.
6. Shake gently to combine. Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent excessive foam from the castile soap.
7. Spray onto countertops, appliances, cabinet fronts, or tile and wipe with a clean microfiber cloth.

## Why It Works

White vinegar contains approximately 5% acetic acid, which dissolves mineral deposits, cuts through grease, and kills many common household bacteria. Lemon juice adds citric acid, a second organic acid that works synergistically with acetic acid to tackle different types of grime. Citric acid is particularly effective at dissolving hard water stains and soap scum.

Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant that reduces the surface tension of water, allowing the solution to spread across surfaces and penetrate into grease rather than beading on top. This combination of two acids and a surfactant handles the range of messes that accumulate over winter -- kitchen grease, bathroom soap scum, and dusty windowsills.

## Tips

- **Infuse for extra power.** Drop citrus peels into a jar of white vinegar and let it sit for two weeks before straining. Use this citrus-infused vinegar in place of plain vinegar for stronger cleaning and a natural fragrance without essential oils.
- **Avoid mixing with bleach.** Never combine this spray with bleach or hydrogen peroxide products. Vinegar plus bleach creates toxic chlorine gas.
- **Streak-free glass.** For windows and mirrors, skip the castile soap and use only vinegar, water, and lemon juice. The soap can leave a slight film on glass.
- **Shelf life.** This spray stays effective for about one month. The vinegar acts as a preservative, but the lemon juice and castile soap degrade over time. Make fresh batches for best results.
