## Steps

1. Combine 2 cups of distilled water and 1/4 cup of white vinegar in a medium mixing bowl. Distilled water is important because tap water minerals leave residue on surfaces.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol and 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap. Stir gently to combine without creating excessive foam.
3. Add 8 drops of peppermint essential oil if desired. Peppermint contains menthol which can help open nasal passages when you inhale the scent during cleaning.
4. Stack 12 cotton or microfiber cloths and roll them loosely, or fold each one into quarters.
5. Place the cloths into an airtight container (a mason jar or repurposed wipes container works well). Pour the solution evenly over the cloths until they are saturated but not dripping.
6. Press the cloths down to ensure the solution reaches every layer. Seal the container tightly.
7. To use, pull one wipe from the container and wipe down windowsills, countertops, nightstands, light switches, and other surfaces where pollen settles. The damp cloth traps pollen particles instead of scattering them into the air.

## Why It Works

Pollen grains are microscopic particles (15-100 micrometers) with a sticky outer coating called pollenkitt that helps them adhere to surfaces. Dry dusting simply launches pollen back into the air where it triggers allergic reactions. A damp cloth physically traps pollen particles, and the cleaning solution ensures they stay trapped.

White vinegar dissolves the protein-based pollenkitt coating, releasing pollen grains from the surface so they transfer to the cloth. Rubbing alcohol accelerates evaporation so surfaces dry quickly without leaving moisture that promotes mold growth -- a secondary allergen concern during spring.

Castile soap acts as a surfactant that lowers the surface tension of the solution, allowing it to flow into crevices along windowsills and baseboards where pollen accumulates. The soap also emulsifies the oily pollenkitt residue, ensuring a cleaner surface after wiping.

## Tips

- **Wipe in one direction.** Drag the cloth in a single direction rather than scrubbing back and forth. This collects pollen into the cloth rather than spreading it around.
- **Prioritize entry points.** Focus on windowsills, door frames, entryway tables, and surfaces near air vents. These are where outdoor pollen enters and concentrates indoors.
- **Wash and reuse.** After using a wipe, toss it in the laundry. Once the batch is washed, re-soak in fresh solution. Each cloth can be reused dozens of times.
- **Morning wipe-down.** Pollen counts peak in the early morning. Wiping high-traffic surfaces before noon removes the heaviest pollen deposits of the day.
