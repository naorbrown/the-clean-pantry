## Steps

1. Combine 2 cups of distilled water and 1/4 cup of white vinegar in a medium mixing bowl.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol and 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap. Stir gently to combine.
3. Add 8 drops of peppermint essential oil if desired.
4. Stack 12 cotton or microfiber cloths and roll them loosely, or fold each one into quarters.
5. Place the cloths into an airtight container. Pour the solution evenly over the cloths until saturated but not dripping.
6. Press the cloths down to ensure the solution reaches every layer. Seal the container tightly.
7. Pull one wipe from the container and wipe down windowsills, countertops, nightstands, light switches, and other surfaces where pollen settles.

## Why It Works

Dry dusting launches pollen back into the air. A damp cloth physically traps pollen, and the cleaning solution ensures particles stay trapped.

White vinegar dissolves the sticky coating on pollen grains, releasing them from surfaces so they transfer to the cloth. Rubbing alcohol speeds evaporation so surfaces dry quickly without leaving moisture that promotes mold.

Castile soap lowers the surface tension of the solution, letting it flow into crevices along windowsills and baseboards where pollen accumulates.

## Tips

- **Wipe in one direction.** Drag the cloth in a single direction rather than scrubbing back and forth.
- **Prioritize entry points.** Focus on windowsills, door frames, entryway tables, and surfaces near air vents.
- **Wash and reuse.** Toss used wipes in the laundry, then re-soak in fresh solution.
- **Morning wipe-down.** Pollen counts peak early morning — wipe high-traffic surfaces before noon.
