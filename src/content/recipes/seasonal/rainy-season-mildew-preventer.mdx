## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide into an opaque or dark-colored 16 oz spray bottle. Light breaks down hydrogen peroxide, so a clear bottle will reduce shelf life significantly.
2. Add 1/2 cup of distilled water.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. At these dilute concentrations, combining vinegar and hydrogen peroxide in the same bottle is safe and effective.
4. Add 15 drops of tea tree essential oil and 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish soap.
5. Cap tightly and shake to combine.
6. Spray onto shower grout, window seals, closet walls, under-sink areas, and any surface prone to moisture during rainy stretches. Apply a light, even coat.
7. Leave the spray on the surface without rinsing. Allow it to air dry. The active ingredients continue working as they dry, leaving a residual antimicrobial layer.

## Why It Works

Mildew is an early-stage surface fungus that thrives in humidity above 60%, a condition easily reached during extended rainy periods. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer that releases reactive oxygen species when it contacts organic material. These oxygen radicals destroy the cell walls of mildew spores, killing existing growth and sterilizing the surface to prevent regrowth.

Tea tree oil contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound proven to inhibit fungal growth for days after application. When hydrogen peroxide finishes its rapid oxidation within minutes, the tea tree oil residue provides a longer-lasting antifungal barrier. This two-stage approach -- immediate kill from peroxide followed by sustained prevention from tea tree -- is what makes this spray effective as a preventative treatment, not just a reactive cleaner.

The small amount of vinegar lowers the solution's pH, creating a mildly acidic environment that is inhospitable to mold and mildew. Most household mildew species prefer neutral to slightly alkaline conditions.

## Tips

- **Apply before rain season starts.** Spray problem areas preventatively when you know extended wet weather is coming. Prevention is far easier than removal.
- **Ventilate closets.** This spray works best when combined with good airflow. Crack closet doors during humid weather or add a small fan to improve circulation.
- **Refresh every two weeks.** The tea tree oil residue degrades over time. Reapply every 10-14 days during persistently humid periods for continuous protection.
- **Pair with a dehumidifier.** In basements and bathrooms without windows, this spray plus a dehumidifier set to maintain 45-50% humidity is the most effective mildew prevention strategy.
