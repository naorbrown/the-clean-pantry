## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide into an opaque 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of distilled water.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar.
4. Add 15 drops of tea tree essential oil and 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish soap.
5. Cap tightly and shake to combine.
6. Spray onto shower grout, window seals, closet walls, under-sink areas, and any moisture-prone surface. Apply a light, even coat.
7. Do not rinse. Allow to air dry — the active ingredients leave a residual antimicrobial layer.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide releases reactive oxygen that destroys mildew cell walls on contact. Tea tree oil inhibits fungal growth for days after application, providing a lasting barrier after the peroxide finishes its rapid oxidation. This two-stage approach — immediate kill plus sustained prevention — makes it a preventative treatment, not just a reactive cleaner.

The vinegar lowers the solution's pH, creating an acidic environment inhospitable to mold and mildew.

## Tips

- **Apply before rain season starts.** Prevention is far easier than removal.
- **Ventilate closets.** Crack closet doors during humid weather or add a small fan.
- **Refresh every two weeks.** Reapply every 10-14 days during persistently humid periods.
- **Pair with a dehumidifier.** In windowless basements and bathrooms, set to 45-50% humidity.
