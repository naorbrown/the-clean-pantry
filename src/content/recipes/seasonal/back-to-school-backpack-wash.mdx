## Steps

1. Empty the backpack completely. Check all pockets and turn the bag inside out to shake loose debris.
2. Fill a large basin or bathtub with 1 gallon of warm water (not hot).
3. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap and 1/4 cup of baking soda. Stir until dissolved.
4. Submerge the backpack inside out. Let it soak for 20 minutes.
5. Scrub stained areas with a soft brush, focusing on the bottom panel and shoulder strap contact points.
6. Drain the basin and rinse under cool running water until no soap remains. Squeeze gently — do not wring.
7. Mix 2 tablespoons of white vinegar into a bowl of clean water and do a final rinse.
8. Hang the backpack upside down in a well-ventilated area to air dry completely (12-24 hours). Ensure it is bone dry before storing.

## Why It Works

Castile soap emulsifies oils from sweat, food, and skin, breaking them into tiny droplets that rinse away. Unlike synthetic detergents, it leaves no chemical residue on fabric.

Baking soda neutralizes acidic odor compounds in sweat and food residue, converting them into odorless salts rather than masking them with fragrance.

The vinegar rinse neutralizes the alkaline film castile soap can leave on synthetic fabrics, leaving them soft and residue-free.

## Tips

- **Spot treat stains first.** Make a paste of baking soda and water and apply directly to stains for 10 minutes before the full soak.
- **Deodorize zippers.** Run a cotton swab dipped in the vinegar solution along zipper tracks.
- **Speed up drying.** Stuff the backpack loosely with crumpled newspaper — it wicks moisture and cuts drying time in half.
- **Refresh between deep cleans.** Sprinkle baking soda inside overnight, then vacuum it out in the morning.
