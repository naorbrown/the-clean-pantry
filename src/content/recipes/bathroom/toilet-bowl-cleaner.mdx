## Steps

1. Pour 1/2 cup of baking soda directly into the toilet bowl, spreading it around the sides.
2. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into the bowl. The mixture will fizz vigorously.
3. Let the fizzing solution sit for 10 minutes. The reaction will loosen stains and buildup.
4. Scrub the bowl with a toilet brush, paying attention to the waterline and under the rim.
5. Flush to rinse.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild abrasive that physically loosens stains without scratching porcelain. When vinegar (acetic acid) meets baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), the resulting carbon dioxide gas creates a fizzing action that gets underneath mineral deposits and organic buildup, lifting them from the surface. The vinegar also neutralizes odor-causing bacteria, leaving the bowl deodorized.

## Alternative

- For tough hard water rings, let the baking soda and vinegar sit for 30 minutes instead of 10, or apply the baking soda as a paste directly to the stain before adding vinegar.
- Substitute 1/4 cup of citric acid powder for the vinegar. Citric acid is more effective against calcium-based hard water stains and produces a similar fizzing reaction.

## Tips

- For routine maintenance, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the bowl before bed and scrub briefly in the morning.
- If stains persist after one application, repeat the process or leave the solution overnight before scrubbing.
