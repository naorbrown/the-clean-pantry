## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of distilled water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle. Using distilled water is important — tap water minerals cause streaks.
2. Add 1/4 cup of rubbing alcohol and 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch. This is the secret ingredient for a perfectly streak-free finish.
4. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake the bottle vigorously for 10 seconds to suspend the cornstarch. Shake before each use, as the cornstarch settles.
5. Mist the mirror lightly with the solution. Less is more — oversaturating the surface creates drips that leave streaks.
6. Wipe immediately with a lint-free microfiber cloth using a Z-pattern (top to bottom, side to side) to avoid circular smear marks. Flip the cloth to a dry side and buff to a shine.

## Why It Works

Rubbing alcohol is a fast-evaporating solvent that dissolves fingerprints, hairspray, and other oily residues on contact. Because it evaporates quickly, it does not leave behind moisture that causes streaking. Vinegar cuts through hard water spots and soap splatter with its mild acidity. The unexpected ingredient — cornstarch — works as a very fine polishing abrasive. The microscopic starch granules gently buff the glass surface as you wipe, leaving it optically clear. Using distilled water eliminates dissolved minerals that would otherwise deposit on the glass as the solution dries.

## Tips

- Always shake the bottle before spraying. The cornstarch settles to the bottom within a few minutes.
- Clean mirrors on a cool, cloudy day or when the mirror is not in direct sunlight. Heat causes the solution to evaporate too quickly, leaving residue before you can wipe it.
- Newspaper can substitute for a microfiber cloth in a pinch — the ink acts as a mild abrasive and the paper is lint-free.
- For heavily soiled mirrors, spray once and wipe to remove the bulk of the grime, then spray a second time and buff for a streak-free finish.
