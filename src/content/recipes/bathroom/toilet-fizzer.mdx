## Steps

1. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup of baking soda, 1/2 cup of citric acid, and 1/4 cup of cornstarch until fully combined and lump-free.
2. In a small separate container, combine 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide with 15 drops of tea tree oil and 10 drops of peppermint oil.
3. Very slowly drizzle the liquid mixture into the dry ingredients while stirring constantly. Add it a few drops at a time — if you add too much liquid at once, the mixture will begin fizzing prematurely.
4. The mixture should feel like slightly damp sand and hold its shape when pressed together. If it is too dry, mist lightly with water from a spray bottle, one spritz at a time.
5. Pack the mixture firmly into silicone molds, ice cube trays, or shape into balls by pressing tightly in your palm. Each tablet should be about 1.5 inches across.
6. Let the tablets dry in a cool, dry location for at least 8 to 12 hours until completely hardened.
7. Store the finished tablets in an airtight jar or container. To use, drop one tablet into the toilet bowl, let it fizz for 5 minutes, then scrub and flush.

## Why It Works

The core cleaning reaction is an acid-base reaction between citric acid and baking soda. When they contact water, they produce carbon dioxide gas — the fizzing action that agitates the water and lifts grime from the porcelain surface. Citric acid also dissolves hard water mineral deposits (calcium carbonate) through an acid-base reaction. Tea tree oil is a proven antimicrobial agent that disrupts bacterial cell membranes, and peppermint oil provides both a pleasant scent and mild antibacterial properties. Cornstarch acts as a binding agent that holds the tablets together and slows the fizzing reaction so it lasts longer.

## Tips

- Make tablets in batches and store them in a glass jar near the toilet for convenient weekly cleaning.
- If the mixture starts fizzing while you are mixing, work faster and reduce the liquid. The reaction is harmless but it means your tablets will be less potent.
- For extra whitening, add 1 tablespoon of oxygen bleach powder (sodium percarbonate) to the dry ingredients.
- Silicone muffin molds work well for making uniform tablets that pop out easily once dry.
