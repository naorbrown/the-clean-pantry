## Steps

1. In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of coarse salt. The salt adds extra scrubbing texture for tough stains.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Stir to form a thick, gritty paste.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. The mixture will fizz briefly — stir until it settles into a spreadable consistency.
4. Wet the stained areas of the tub with warm water. Apply the paste directly onto the bathtub ring and any discolored areas using a sponge or cloth.
5. Let the paste sit on the stains for 15 minutes. For stubborn rings, extend to 20 minutes.
6. Scrub the treated areas with a non-scratch scrub sponge using firm circular motions. The salt and baking soda will provide abrasion without damaging porcelain or enamel.
7. Rinse the entire tub thoroughly with warm water. Wipe dry with a clean towel to prevent new water spots.

## Why It Works

Bathtub rings form when body oils, dead skin cells, and soap residue combine with hard water minerals and adhere to the tub surface at the waterline. Baking soda and salt work as a dual-abrasive system — baking soda is soft enough to avoid scratching while salt provides coarser texture for stubborn deposits. Castile soap is a surfactant that emulsifies body oils, breaking them into tiny droplets that rinse away with water. Vinegar dissolves the calcium and magnesium mineral component of the ring, and lemon juice adds citric acid that further attacks mineral bonds while providing natural degreasing action.

## Tips

- Prevent bathtub rings by wiping down the tub at the waterline after each bath. A quick swipe with a sponge takes 30 seconds and prevents buildup entirely.
- For acrylic or fiberglass tubs, omit the salt and use baking soda alone as the abrasive — salt can micro-scratch soft plastic surfaces.
- If the ring has a yellow or rust tint, it is likely iron in your water. Add 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar to the paste for extra rust-dissolving power.
- Rinse the tub thoroughly after cleaning to remove all paste residue. Any leftover baking soda or soap film will make the tub dangerously slippery.
