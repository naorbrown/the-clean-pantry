## Steps

1. Warm 1 cup of white vinegar in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds. It should be warm but not boiling. Warming the vinegar increases its cleaning power.
2. Pour the warm vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
3. Add 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of liquid dish soap.
4. Cap the bottle and gently swirl to combine. Avoid shaking vigorously, which creates excessive foam.
5. Spray the solution generously onto the shower door glass, covering the entire surface including edges and corners where buildup is heaviest.
6. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. For heavy hard water deposits, let it sit for 30 minutes.
7. Scrub the glass with a non-scratch sponge or microfiber cloth using circular motions.
8. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and squeegee the glass from top to bottom to prevent new water spots.

## Why It Works

Soap scum is a white film made of calcium stearate, created when the fatty acids in soap react with calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves calcium stearate by breaking it back into its soluble components. Hard water spots are mineral deposits (primarily calcium carbonate) left behind when water evaporates — acetic acid dissolves these readily. The dish soap serves as a surfactant that helps the vinegar solution cling to the vertical glass surface instead of running off immediately, giving the acid more contact time. It also helps emulsify and lift oily residues from body oils and shampoo.

## Tips

- Use this cleaner weekly to prevent heavy buildup. A quick spray and wipe takes 5 minutes and eliminates the need for heavy scrubbing sessions.
- Squeegee the shower door after every shower. This single habit prevents 90% of water spot and soap scum buildup.
- For extremely stubborn hard water spots, apply undiluted vinegar with a cloth, press the cloth against the glass, and leave it for 1 hour before scrubbing.
- A paste of baking soda and water on a damp sponge works as a gentle abrasive for spots that resist the spray alone. Apply it after the vinegar treatment.
- Switch to liquid body wash or castile soap — bar soap is the primary cause of soap scum because it contains animal fat (tallow) or plant fat that reacts with hard water minerals.

## Alternative

- Substitute lemon juice for the vinegar if you prefer a citrus scent. Lemon juice contains citric acid, which dissolves mineral deposits similarly to acetic acid.
- For a no-scrub daily maintenance spray, mix 1 cup of water with 1/4 cup of rubbing alcohol and 1 tablespoon of dish soap. Spray on after each shower — the alcohol helps water sheet off the glass.
