## Steps

1. Pour 1.5 cups of water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 5 drops of tea tree essential oil.
4. Cap the bottle and shake well to combine.
5. After each shower, spray a light, even mist over the shower walls, tiles, grout lines, and any areas prone to moisture buildup.
6. Do not rinse or wipe. Leave the spray on the surface to air-dry. The residual vinegar and tea tree oil create an inhospitable environment for mold spores.

## Why It Works

Mold requires three things to grow: moisture, organic matter (soap residue, skin cells), and a surface. This spray targets the biological component. Vinegar's acetic acid lowers the surface pH to a level that inhibits mold spore germination. At the diluted concentration in this spray, it does not damage tile or grout but is acidic enough to disrupt the early stages of mold colonization. Tea tree oil contains terpinen-4-ol, a natural antifungal compound that kills mold spores on contact and leaves a residual layer that continues working after the spray dries. The key to this spray is consistent daily use — it prevents mold from establishing rather than trying to kill established colonies.

## Alternative

- If you have pets and cannot use tea tree oil safely, substitute 10 drops of clove essential oil, which has antifungal properties and is less toxic to animals. Always research specific oil safety for your pet species.
- For a completely oil-free option, use a solution of 1 part white vinegar to 2 parts water without any essential oil. It is less effective but still provides meaningful mold prevention with daily use.
## Tips

- This is a prevention spray, not a treatment spray. If you already have visible mold, remove it first with undiluted vinegar or a dedicated mold remover, then begin using this spray daily to prevent regrowth.
- Shake the bottle before each use. Tea tree oil does not dissolve in water and will float on the surface if not agitated.
- The combined smell of vinegar and tea tree oil fades within 15 to 20 minutes.
- Run your bathroom exhaust fan for at least 15 minutes after every shower. Reducing moisture is the most effective mold prevention strategy, and this spray supplements that effort.
- Keep a squeegee in the shower and wipe down the glass and walls before spraying. Removing standing water first makes the prevention spray significantly more effective.
- Replace the batch every 3 to 4 weeks. The tea tree oil maintains potency but the vinegar concentration can decrease slightly over time.
