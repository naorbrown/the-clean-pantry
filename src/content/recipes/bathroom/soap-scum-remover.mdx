## Steps

1. Heat 1 cup of white vinegar in the microwave for 30 seconds until warm. Warm vinegar is more effective at dissolving mineral deposits.
2. Pour the warm vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid dish soap and 1/2 cup of warm water. Swirl gently to combine without creating excess foam.
3. Spray the solution generously onto soap scum-covered surfaces — shower doors, tile walls, and faucet fixtures.
4. Let the solution sit for 10 to 15 minutes. For heavy buildup, allow up to 20 minutes.
5. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda onto a damp sponge or scrub brush. Scrub the treated areas in circular motions. The baking soda provides gentle abrasion to lift stubborn residue.
6. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and wipe dry with a clean cloth to prevent new water spots from forming.

## Why It Works

Soap scum is a white or gray film created when fatty acids in bar soap react with calcium and magnesium minerals in hard water, forming an insoluble salt called calcium stearate. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves these mineral bonds, breaking the scum back into its soluble components. Dish soap acts as a surfactant, penetrating beneath the loosened scum and lifting it away from the surface. The baking soda provides a mild mechanical abrasive (2.5 on the Mohs hardness scale) that scrubs away residue without scratching glass or ceramic surfaces.

## Tips

- For maintenance, spray shower doors with a 1:1 vinegar-water solution after each shower. This prevents soap scum from building up in the first place.
- Switch to liquid body wash instead of bar soap to dramatically reduce soap scum formation — liquid soaps use synthetic detergents that do not react with hard water minerals.
- Do not use this recipe on marble, granite, or natural stone surfaces. The acid in vinegar will etch and damage these materials.
- A squeegee used after every shower is the single most effective way to prevent soap scum buildup on glass doors.
