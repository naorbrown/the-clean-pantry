## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup baking soda and 2 tablespoons liquid castile soap in a small bowl.
2. Stir until the mixture forms a smooth, slightly gritty paste.
3. Apply the paste to the tub, shower walls, or fixtures using a damp sponge or cloth.
4. Scrub in circular motions, focusing on areas with visible soap scum or hard water stains.
5. Let the paste sit on stubborn spots for 5 minutes.
6. Rinse thoroughly with warm water.
7. Dry with a clean cloth to prevent new water spots from forming.

## Why It Works

Soap scum is a combination of body oils, soap residue, and hard water minerals that bonds to surfaces over time. The baking soda provides gentle mechanical abrasion to break that bond without scratching the finish. Castile soap acts as a surfactant, emulsifying the oily component of soap scum so it rinses away cleanly instead of smearing around. Together they tackle both the mineral and organic layers of buildup.

## Alternative

- For heavy soap scum, spray the area with undiluted white vinegar first, let it sit 5 minutes, then apply the baking soda paste. The acid-base reaction helps break down the thicker deposits.
- Replace castile soap with dish soap (1 tbsp) mixed with 1/4 cup white vinegar for a more aggressive formula that works well on glass shower doors.

## Tips

- Do not use on marble, travertine, or other natural stone. The abrasive paste and alkaline soap can dull polished surfaces.
- Make the paste fresh each time. It loses its cleaning power if stored because the soap slowly reacts with the baking soda.
- A stiff-bristled brush works better than a sponge on textured tub floors.
