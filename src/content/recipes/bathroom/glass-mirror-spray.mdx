## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Attach the spray nozzle and shake gently to mix.
4. Spray the solution onto the glass or mirror surface.
5. Wipe immediately with a lint-free microfiber cloth or crumpled newspaper, using straight strokes from top to bottom.
6. Buff any remaining streaks with a dry section of the cloth.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves the alkaline mineral deposits (calcium and magnesium) left by hard water, which are the primary cause of cloudy glass. The dilute concentration evaporates quickly and cleanly, leaving no residue behind -- this is what produces the streak-free finish. Commercial glass cleaners work on the same principle but add surfactants and fragrances that can actually leave film behind.

## Alternative

- Add 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) to the mix for faster evaporation, which helps in humid environments where streaking is more likely.
- For a vinegar-free option, mix 2 cups of water with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. The fine starch particles act as a mild polishing agent and absorb grime. Shake well before each use since the cornstarch settles.

## Tips

- Use distilled water to avoid introducing new mineral deposits onto the glass.
- Clean glass on a cloudy day or when the surface is cool. Direct sunlight causes the spray to evaporate too fast, leaving streaks before you can wipe.
- Microfiber cloths outperform paper towels. They grab and hold particles instead of pushing them around.
- The vinegar smell dissipates within 15-20 minutes as the solution dries.
