## Steps

1. Warm 1/4 cup of the distilled water in the microwave for 15 seconds. Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda and stir until completely dissolved. Undissolved baking soda will clog the spray nozzle.
2. Pour the baking soda solution into a 16 oz spray bottle.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of vodka or rubbing alcohol.
4. Add 15 drops of essential oil.
5. Fill the remainder of the bottle with the rest of the distilled water.
6. Cap and shake well to combine all ingredients.
7. To use, hold the bottle 8-10 inches from the fabric and mist lightly. The fabric should be barely damp, not wet.
8. Let the fabric air dry completely. The odor will be gone as the spray dries.

## Why It Works

Fabric odors come from bacteria metabolizing sweat, body oils, and environmental compounds trapped in textile fibers. The alcohol in this spray kills the bacteria on contact by denaturing their cell proteins. Baking soda neutralizes the acidic volatile fatty acids (particularly isovaleric acid and propionic acid) that are the primary odor compounds produced by skin bacteria. The essential oils provide a pleasant scent and, depending on the oil chosen, contribute additional antimicrobial action -- lavender oil contains linalool with proven antibacterial properties, while tea tree oil contains terpinen-4-ol that disrupts microbial cell membranes. Distilled water is used to prevent mineral deposits on fabrics. The fine mist application is key: too much liquid pushes odor compounds deeper into the fabric rather than neutralizing them at the surface.

## Tips

- Shake before every use. The essential oils and baking soda settle between uses.
- Do not use on silk, suede, or leather. These materials can water-spot or be damaged by alcohol.
- This spray works especially well on items that are difficult to wash frequently: couch cushions, throw pillows, winter coats, and suits.
- For gym bags and sports equipment, increase the alcohol to 3 tablespoons for stronger antibacterial action.
- Make a travel-size version in a 2 oz spray bottle for freshening clothes while traveling.
