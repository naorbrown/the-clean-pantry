## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of baking soda, 1/4 cup of cornstarch, and 1/4 cup of arrowroot powder in a bowl.
2. Add 15 drops of tea tree or peppermint essential oil. Stir thoroughly with a fork, pressing out any oil clumps.
3. Transfer the powder to an airtight jar for storage.
4. To use, sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons of powder directly into each shoe, focusing on the toe box and heel area.
5. Shake the shoe gently to distribute the powder across the entire insole.
6. Leave the powder in the shoes overnight (at least 8 hours).
7. Tap out the loose powder into a trash can before wearing the shoes. A quick shake is usually sufficient.
8. Repeat after every wear for athletic shoes, or weekly for everyday shoes.

## Why It Works

Foot odor is caused primarily by Brevibacterium linens and Staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteria that thrive in the warm, moist environment inside shoes. These bacteria metabolize sweat and dead skin cells, producing isovaleric acid -- the compound responsible for the characteristic "cheesy" foot smell. Baking soda neutralizes isovaleric acid through a direct acid-base reaction, converting it into an odorless sodium salt. Cornstarch and arrowroot powder absorb moisture (each gram of starch can absorb several times its weight in water), depriving the bacteria of the wet environment they need to reproduce. Tea tree oil provides antimicrobial action through its terpinen-4-ol content, which disrupts bacterial cell membranes. The overnight duration is important because it gives the powder time to absorb moisture from deep within the shoe insole and midsole foam, not just the surface.

## Tips

- Store the powder in a jar with a shaker lid (like a repurposed spice jar) for easy application.
- For shoes that are already extremely smelly, remove the insoles and treat them separately. Sprinkle powder on both sides of the insole and let it sit for 24 hours.
- Do not use this powder in suede-lined shoes or sandals with delicate materials. The powder can leave visible residue.
- Rotating between two pairs of shoes so each pair has 24 hours to dry out between wears is the most effective long-term odor prevention strategy.
- Tea tree oil is the most effective essential oil for shoe odor specifically because it targets the exact bacteria responsible for foot smell.
