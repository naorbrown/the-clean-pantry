## Steps

1. In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup of baking soda with 10 drops of tea tree essential oil and 5 drops of lavender essential oil. Stir with a fork, pressing out any oil clumps until the mixture is uniform.
2. Lay out one square of muslin or cotton fabric flat.
3. Spoon half of the baking soda mixture (about 1/4 cup) into the center of the fabric.
4. Gather the edges of the fabric up around the baking soda to form a pouch. Twist the gathered fabric and tie it tightly with twine, ribbon, or a rubber band. The sachet should be snug enough that baking soda does not leak out, but loose enough that air can pass through the fabric.
5. Repeat with the second piece of fabric and the remaining baking soda.
6. Place one sachet inside each shoe after wearing. Push them into the toe box where moisture accumulates the most.
7. Leave the sachets in the shoes until the next wear. Remove them before putting on the shoes.
8. Refresh the sachets every 3-4 weeks by untying them, discarding the old baking soda, and refilling with a fresh mixture.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is both a moisture absorber and an odor neutralizer. It absorbs the moisture that bacteria need to thrive inside shoes, and it chemically neutralizes isovaleric acid -- the primary compound responsible for foot odor -- through an acid-base reaction that converts the smelly acid into an odorless sodium salt. The muslin fabric acts as a breathable membrane: it allows air and moisture vapor to pass through and reach the baking soda while containing the powder so it does not coat the inside of the shoe. Tea tree oil adds sustained antimicrobial action through its terpinen-4-ol content, which disrupts bacterial and fungal cell membranes on contact. The sachet format makes the treatment reusable and mess-free compared to loose powder.

## Tips

- Make 3-4 pairs of sachets and rotate them. While one pair is in your shoes, the others can air out on a windowsill, which helps the baking soda release absorbed moisture and recharge its absorptive capacity.
- Muslin bags from craft stores or loose-leaf tea bags work perfectly. You can also repurpose clean, thin cotton socks.
- For athletic shoes that are very sweaty, increase the baking soda to 1/3 cup per sachet and add 2 extra drops of tea tree oil.
- The sachets also work in gym bags, gear lockers, and boot storage.
- If the sachet fabric becomes stained or develops an odor itself, replace the fabric. Baking soda can be reused if it is still dry and powdery.
- Store unused baking soda mixture in a sealed jar. It keeps indefinitely.
