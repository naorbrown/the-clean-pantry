## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a heat-safe glass jar or metal cup inside a small saucepan with 2 inches of water.
2. Add 1 oz of beeswax and 2 oz of coconut oil to the jar. Heat over low-medium until both are fully melted, stirring occasionally.
3. Remove from heat and stir in 1 oz of sweet almond oil. The almond oil is added off-heat to preserve its vitamin E content.
4. Pour the mixture into a small tin or jar. Let it cool at room temperature for 1-2 hours until it solidifies into a soft balm.
5. To apply, use a soft lint-free cloth to scoop a small amount of conditioner. Rub it between your fingers to warm and soften it.
6. Apply to the leather in small circular motions, working the conditioner into the surface. Use thin, even coats.
7. Let the conditioner absorb for 15-20 minutes.
8. Buff the surface with a second clean, dry cloth to remove excess and bring out the leather's natural sheen.

## Why It Works

Leather is animal skin that has been stabilized through tanning, but it retains a fibrous collagen structure that needs moisture to stay supple. Without conditioning, the natural oils in leather gradually evaporate, causing the collagen fibers to stiffen, crack, and eventually break. Coconut oil penetrates deeply into the collagen matrix because its lauric acid molecules are small enough to fit between the fiber bundles. Sweet almond oil is rich in oleic acid and vitamin E, which condition the surface and provide antioxidant protection against UV damage. Beeswax creates a breathable surface barrier that locks in the oils and provides water resistance. The wax molecules fill micro-cracks in the leather surface, smoothing the finish. This three-component system mirrors commercial leather conditioners: a penetrating oil, a nourishing oil, and a protective wax.

## Tips

- Apply conditioner to leather every 3-6 months, or whenever the leather feels dry or stiff. Over-conditioning can clog the leather's pores and make it feel sticky.
- This conditioner will slightly darken most leathers. Test on the inside of a belt or the bottom of a bag first.
- Do not use on suede or nubuck. These are unfinished leathers with a raised nap that oils will permanently darken and flatten.
- For shoes, clean them with a damp cloth first to remove dirt. Dirt particles trapped under the conditioner act as an abrasive.
- Store the conditioner at room temperature in the sealed tin. It will last 1-2 years. If it separates, re-melt gently and let it re-solidify.
