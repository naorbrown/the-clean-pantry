## Steps

1. Pour 1.5 cups of distilled water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of vodka.
3. Add 15 drops of essential oil. Lavender creates a calming bedroom atmosphere; lemon gives a bright, clean scent for living areas.
4. Cap the bottle and shake well to combine.
5. Open a window in the room for ventilation.
6. Hold the bottle about 12 inches from the curtains and mist lightly across the full surface, starting from the top and working down.
7. Pull the curtains slightly away from the wall to allow air to circulate behind them as they dry.
8. Let the curtains air dry. The vinegar smell will dissipate within 15-20 minutes.

## Why It Works

Curtains act as large fabric filters that trap cooking odors, pet dander, dust, cigarette smoke, and environmental pollutants over time. Because they hang in place for months or years, the accumulated odor compounds can be substantial. The vinegar in this spray neutralizes the alkaline amine compounds responsible for cooking and smoke odors through acid-base reactions. The vodka provides ethanol, which is a broad-spectrum solvent that dissolves both water-soluble and oil-soluble odor compounds -- it also evaporates quickly without leaving residue. Essential oils contribute pleasant fragrance and, in the case of lavender and tea tree, antimicrobial properties that inhibit the mold and mildew spores that colonize curtain fabric in humid environments. The fine mist application ensures the curtains become barely damp rather than wet, preventing water spots and allowing rapid drying.

## Tips

- Freshen curtains monthly, or whenever they start to hold noticeable cooking or pet odors.
- Do not use this on silk, velvet, or dry-clean-only curtains. These fabrics can water-spot or be damaged by the vinegar.
- For curtains near the kitchen, increase the vinegar to 3 tablespoons to combat stronger cooking odors.
- The best time to freshen curtains is on a breezy day with windows open. The cross-ventilation helps the spray dry quickly and carries the released odor compounds out of the room.
- If curtains have visible dust, vacuum them with an upholstery attachment before spraying. The spray addresses odor, not dust.
