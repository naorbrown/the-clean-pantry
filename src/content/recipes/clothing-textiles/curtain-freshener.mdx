## Steps

1. Pour 1.5 cups of distilled water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of vodka.
3. Add 15 drops of essential oil.
4. Cap and shake well.
5. Open a window for ventilation.
6. Hold the bottle 12 inches from the curtains and mist lightly from top to bottom.
7. Pull curtains slightly away from the wall so air circulates behind them.
8. Let air dry. The vinegar smell dissipates within 15-20 minutes.

## Why It Works

Vinegar neutralizes the alkaline amine compounds responsible for cooking and smoke odors. Vodka's ethanol dissolves both water-soluble and oil-soluble odor compounds and evaporates without residue. Essential oils add fragrance and antimicrobial properties that inhibit mold and mildew on fabric.

## Tips

- Freshen curtains monthly, or whenever cooking or pet odors become noticeable.
- Do not use on silk, velvet, or dry-clean-only curtains.
- For kitchen curtains, increase vinegar to 3 tablespoons.
- Best on a breezy day with windows open for fast drying.
- Vacuum curtains with an upholstery attachment before spraying if they have visible dust.
