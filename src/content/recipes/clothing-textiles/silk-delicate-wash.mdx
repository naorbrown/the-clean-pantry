## Steps

1. Fill a clean basin with cool water. Add 1/2 teaspoon of baby shampoo and swirl gently until dissolved.
2. Submerge the silk garment and press it gently beneath the water surface. Let it soak for 5 minutes. Do not scrub, twist, or rub the fabric against itself.
3. Gently move the garment through the water with a slow, swishing motion for about 30 seconds. Think of it as gently waving the fabric back and forth.
4. Drain the soapy water. Refill the basin with fresh cool water and add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.
5. Submerge the garment in the vinegar rinse and swish gently for 30 seconds. The vinegar removes soap residue and restores the silk's natural luster.
6. Lift the garment out of the water, supporting its full weight with both hands. Never let silk hang from one point while wet.
7. Lay the garment flat on a clean white towel. Roll the towel gently to absorb excess water. Do not wring or press hard.
8. For blouses and tops, reshape and drape over a padded hanger to dry. For delicate items like lingerie, lay flat on a drying rack away from direct sunlight and heat.

## Why It Works

Silk is a protein fiber (fibroin) produced by silkworms. Its smooth, lustrous surface comes from a tightly packed crystalline molecular structure that is easily disrupted by heat, alkaline detergents, and mechanical stress. Baby shampoo is the safest cleaning agent for silk because its pH of 5.5-7 is close to silk's natural pH of about 4-6. Alkaline detergents (most laundry soaps are pH 9-11) swell and roughen silk fibers, causing them to lose their smooth hand feel and luster. The vinegar rinse serves two purposes: it neutralizes any residual alkalinity from the shampoo, and it restores the acidic pH that keeps silk fibers tight and smooth. The acidic environment also helps set dye colors, preventing fading during the wash. The no-wringing rule exists because silk fibers have very low elasticity when wet -- stretching or twisting wet silk breaks the molecular chains and creates permanent damage.

## Tips

- Fragrance-free baby shampoo is ideal. Fragrances can stain light-colored silk.
- If the silk garment has a specific stain, dab the stain gently with the shampoo solution and a soft cloth before submerging the whole garment.
- Silk dries quickly due to its low moisture absorption. Most items are dry within 2-4 hours.
- Never iron silk while wet. If pressing is needed, use the lowest iron setting with a pressing cloth between the iron and the silk.
- Store silk garments in breathable cotton garment bags. Plastic bags trap moisture and promote yellowing.
