## Steps

1. Let any wet stains dry completely before cleaning. Attempting to clean wet suede can spread the stain and damage the nap.
2. Use a soft bristle brush to brush the entire suede surface in one direction. This raises the nap and removes surface dust.
3. For dry scuffs and marks, rub gently with a clean white pencil eraser. Use light, short strokes in one direction. The eraser lifts scuff marks without damaging the delicate fibers.
4. For water stains or general soiling, mix 2 tablespoons of white vinegar with 2 tablespoons of distilled water. Dampen a clean white cloth with the solution.
5. Dab (do not rub) the stained area gently. Work from the outside edge of the stain toward the center to prevent spreading.
6. For grease or oil stains, sprinkle cornstarch directly on the stain and let it sit for 2-4 hours. The cornstarch absorbs the oil. Brush it off with the suede brush.
7. Allow the cleaned area to air dry away from direct heat or sunlight.
8. Once dry, brush the entire surface again with the suede brush to restore an even nap direction.

## Why It Works

Suede is the inner split of leather, with a soft, fibrous surface called the nap. The fibers are delicate and easily damaged by water and aggressive cleaning. The pencil eraser works on scuffs because suede scuffs are typically areas where the nap has been pushed flat or where foreign material has been pressed into the surface. The eraser's mild abrasion lifts and realigns the flattened fibers without cutting them. White vinegar is effective on suede stains because its acetic acid dissolves water-soluble stain compounds without saturating the leather the way water does -- vinegar evaporates more completely and is less likely to leave water rings. Cornstarch on grease stains works through adsorption: the fine starch particles physically draw oil out of the suede fibers through capillary action, effectively wicking the grease from the leather into the expendable powder.

## Tips

- Always use a white cloth and white eraser on light-colored suede. Colored materials can transfer dye.
- Never use water to clean suede. Water causes permanent dark spots and stiffening of the leather.
- Brush suede items after every wear to prevent dirt from embedding in the nap. Regular brushing is the single best maintenance practice.
- For salt stains from winter roads, use undiluted white vinegar applied with a cloth. Salt is highly soluble in acetic acid.
- Store suede items in breathable cloth bags, never plastic. Plastic traps moisture and promotes mildew growth on the leather.
