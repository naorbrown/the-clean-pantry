## Steps

1. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to form a thick paste. The mixture may fizz slightly.
2. Flip the cap so the interior sweatband is exposed and easily accessible.
3. Using a soft bristle brush or old toothbrush, apply the paste generously along the entire sweatband, focusing on the forehead area where staining is worst.
4. Work the paste into the fabric with the brush, scrubbing in small circles with moderate pressure. Spend extra time on visible yellow or brown stain lines.
5. If the stain extends beyond the sweatband onto the crown fabric, apply the paste to those areas as well.
6. Let the paste sit on the sweatband for 15-20 minutes. Do not let it dry completely -- if it starts to dry, mist lightly with water.
7. Dampen a clean cloth with cool water and blot the paste away, pressing firmly to lift the dissolved stain. Rinse and wring the cloth frequently.
8. Repeat the blotting until all paste residue is removed and the water blots come away clean.
9. Reshape the cap and place it on a head-shaped form (a bowl, a balled towel, or a balloon) to air dry. Keep the cap out of direct sunlight while drying to prevent fading.

## Why It Works

Hat sweatband stains are a mixture of dried sweat salts (primarily sodium chloride and urea), sebum (skin oil) that has oxidized to a yellow-brown color, and dead skin cells bound together by the oil. This three-part stain requires a three-part approach. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that bleaches the conjugated double bonds in oxidized sebum -- these double bonds are what create the yellow color. Breaking them converts the compounds to colorless forms. Baking soda dissolves the dried salt crystals and provides gentle abrasive action to mechanically loosen the stain from the fabric weave. Dish soap contributes surfactants that emulsify the remaining oil, suspending it in the water so it can be blotted away rather than redeposited onto the fabric. The paste format keeps all three ingredients in contact with the stain for the full 15-20 minutes, which is necessary because the stain has had time to set deeply into the sweatband fibers.

## Tips

- Treat sweatband stains regularly rather than waiting until they are severe. A 5-minute treatment monthly prevents the deep yellowing that is much harder to reverse.
- For white or light-colored caps, this treatment is very effective and safe. For dark-colored caps, the hydrogen peroxide may lighten the dyed fabric, so always test on the underside of the brim first.
- If you prefer to avoid hydrogen peroxide entirely, substitute with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. It will not bleach the stain as effectively, but it dissolves the salt and helps lift the oils.
- After the cap is fully dry, apply a thin line of beeswax along the inner sweatband to create a moisture barrier that makes future stains easier to clean.
- Caps worn during exercise should be treated after every 3-5 wears. Caps worn casually can go longer between treatments.
- This spot-clean method is ideal for structured caps with cardboard-alternative brims (plastic brims) that you do not want to fully submerge.
