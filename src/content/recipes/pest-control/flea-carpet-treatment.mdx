## How to Make It

1. Grind the salt as finely as possible — a blender or mortar and pestle works well. The finer the grain, the better it penetrates carpet fibers.
2. Sprinkle the salt evenly across the entire carpet surface. Use roughly 1 cup per average-sized room. Focus extra attention on areas where pets rest.
3. Use a broom or your hands to work the salt down into the carpet fibers.
4. Leave the salt in the carpet for at least 12 hours, or overnight for best results.
5. Vacuum thoroughly, making multiple passes over each area. Empty the vacuum canister or dispose of the bag immediately in an outdoor trash bin.

## Why It Works

Fine salt acts as a desiccant when it contacts flea eggs and larvae nestled in carpet fibers. The salt crystals absorb moisture through the fleas' thin outer membranes, causing fatal dehydration. This treatment is especially effective against eggs and larvae, which make up the majority of a flea population in your home.

## Tips

- Repeat the treatment every 3-4 days for two weeks to break the flea life cycle.
- Wash all pet bedding in hot water on the same day you treat the carpet.
- Vacuum daily even between salt treatments to remove emerging adult fleas.

## Alternative Approach

Food-grade diatomaceous earth works on the same principle but through a mechanical action — its microscopic edges cut through flea exoskeletons. Sprinkle it on carpets, leave for 12-24 hours, and vacuum. Use only food-grade DE, and avoid inhaling the fine dust during application.
