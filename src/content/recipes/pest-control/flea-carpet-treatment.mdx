## Steps

1. Grind the salt as finely as possible using a blender or mortar and pestle.
2. Sprinkle evenly across the entire carpet, focusing on areas where pets rest.
3. Work the salt down into the fibers with a broom or your hands.
4. Leave for at least 12 hours or overnight.
5. Vacuum thoroughly with multiple passes. Empty the canister or dispose of the bag immediately in an outdoor bin.

## Why It Works

Fine salt acts as a desiccant, absorbing moisture through flea eggs' and larvae's thin outer membranes and causing fatal dehydration. Especially effective against eggs and larvae, which make up the majority of a home flea population.

## Alternative

Food-grade diatomaceous earth works through a mechanical action — its microscopic edges cut through flea exoskeletons. Sprinkle on carpets, leave 12-24 hours, and vacuum. Use only food-grade DE and avoid inhaling the dust.

## Tips

- Repeat every 3-4 days for two weeks to break the flea life cycle.
- Wash all pet bedding in hot water on the same day you treat the carpet.
- Vacuum daily between treatments to remove emerging adult fleas.
