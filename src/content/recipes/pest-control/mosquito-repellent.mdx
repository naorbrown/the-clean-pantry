## Steps

1. Pour 2 oz of alcohol-free witch hazel into a 4 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 30 drops lemon eucalyptus, 15 drops lavender, and 10 drops cedarwood essential oil.
3. Swirl gently to combine oils with witch hazel.
4. Add 2 oz of distilled water to fill.
5. Shake well before each use.
6. Spray exposed arms, legs, and neck from 6-8 inches away. Rub in lightly. Reapply every 1-2 hours.

## Why It Works

Lemon eucalyptus oil contains PMD, a CDC-recognized plant-based mosquito repellent that masks CO2 and lactic acid signals mosquitoes use to find hosts. Lavender's linalool repels biting insects. Cedarwood's cedrol disrupts insect neuroreceptors. Witch hazel helps oils adhere to skin longer than water alone.

## Alternative

Substitute 30 drops of citronella for lemon eucalyptus. Citronella is less effective and needs reapplication every 30-60 minutes.

## Tips

- Do not dilute further — the ~5% concentration is necessary for effective repellency.
- Reapply after swimming or heavy sweating.
- Safe to spray on clothing, hats, and shoes. Test on an inconspicuous spot first.
- Store in a cool, dark place. Lasts about 3 months.
- For children over 3, reduce all oil drops by half.
