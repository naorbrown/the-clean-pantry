## Steps

1. Pour 2 oz of alcohol-free witch hazel into a 4 oz glass spray bottle. Glass is preferable because essential oils can degrade plastic over time.
2. Add 30 drops of lemon eucalyptus essential oil, 15 drops of lavender essential oil, and 10 drops of cedarwood essential oil.
3. Swirl the bottle gently to combine the oils with the witch hazel.
4. Add 2 oz of distilled water to fill the bottle. Tap water can introduce bacteria that shorten the shelf life.
5. Screw on the spray top and shake well before each use. The oils and water will naturally separate between uses, so shaking is essential.
6. To apply, hold the bottle 6-8 inches from your skin and spray exposed arms, legs, and neck. Rub in lightly with your hands. Reapply every 1-2 hours, or more frequently if sweating heavily.

## Why It Works

Lemon eucalyptus oil contains a compound called PMD (para-menthane-3,8-diol), which is one of the only plant-based ingredients recognized by the CDC as an effective mosquito repellent. PMD works by masking the carbon dioxide and lactic acid signals that mosquitoes use to locate human hosts. Studies have shown that oil of lemon eucalyptus provides protection comparable to low concentrations of DEET for several hours.

Lavender oil adds a secondary repellent layer -- mosquitoes and many other biting insects avoid linalool, lavender's primary compound. Cedarwood oil contains cedrol, which disrupts the octopamine neuroreceptors in insects, acting as both a repellent and a mild insecticide on contact.

Witch hazel serves as the carrier and emulsifier, helping the essential oils disperse evenly when sprayed and adhere to the skin longer than water alone.

## Alternative

If you do not have lemon eucalyptus oil, citronella essential oil is a reasonable substitute. Use 30 drops of citronella in place of the lemon eucalyptus. Citronella is a well-known mosquito repellent, though it is somewhat less effective than lemon eucalyptus and needs more frequent reapplication (every 30-60 minutes).
## Tips

- **Concentration matters.** This recipe uses a relatively high essential oil concentration (approximately 5%) for effective repellency. Do not dilute it further, or the repellent effect drops significantly.
- **Reapply after swimming.** Water washes away the oils immediately. Reapply as soon as you towel off.
- **Clothing application.** You can spray this on clothing, hats, and shoes for additional protection. It will not stain most fabrics, but test on an inconspicuous spot first.
- **Storage.** Store in a cool, dark place. The essential oils degrade in heat and UV light. A properly stored batch lasts about 3 months.
- **For children over 3.** Reduce the total essential oil drops by half (15 lemon eucalyptus, 8 lavender, 5 cedarwood) for a gentler version.
