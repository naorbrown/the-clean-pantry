## Steps

1. Pour the water and white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the castile soap and swirl gently to combine.
3. Add all three essential oils: cypress, peppermint, and cedar.
4. Cap the bottle and shake vigorously for 15 seconds to emulsify.
5. Spray along baseboards, under sinks, behind toilets, around refrigerator bases, and anywhere cockroaches have been spotted or droppings found.
6. Pay special attention to cracks, crevices, and pipe entry points. Cockroaches prefer dark, tight spaces.
7. Reapply every 3 to 4 days for active problems, or weekly as a preventive measure. Always shake before spraying.

## Why It Works

Cockroaches detect and avoid certain volatile compounds through their highly sensitive antennae, which are covered in thousands of chemoreceptors. Cypress essential oil contains alpha-pinene and cedrol, compounds that interfere with cockroach neurotransmitter signaling, specifically octopamine receptors that regulate movement and feeding behavior. Research has demonstrated that cypress oil is one of the most effective natural cockroach repellents, with repellency rates above 90 percent in laboratory tests. Peppermint oil's menthol adds a secondary repellent that irritates the roach's spiracles (breathing pores), making treated areas physiologically uncomfortable. Cedar oil contains thujone, which disrupts the pheromone signals that cockroaches use to aggregate in hiding spots. The castile soap serves double duty: it emulsifies the oils into solution and, on direct contact, coats the cockroach's spiracles and suffocates it by blocking oxygen exchange.

## Tips

- Cockroach repellent is only effective when combined with sanitation. Eliminate food and water sources: fix leaky pipes, wipe down counters nightly, and store food in sealed containers.
- Spray in the evening when cockroaches are most active. The fresh scent is most potent in the first few hours.
- For severe infestations, this repellent drives roaches out of treated areas but does not eliminate the population. Combine with boric acid baits for population control.
- Add 10 drops of rosemary essential oil for additional repellent compounds if cypress is unavailable.
- This spray leaves no visible residue on most surfaces but test on porous stone or light-colored grout first.
