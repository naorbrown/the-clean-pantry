## Steps

1. Pour water and white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add castile soap and swirl gently.
3. Add cypress, peppermint, and cedar essential oils.
4. Cap and shake vigorously for 15 seconds.
5. Spray along baseboards, under sinks, behind toilets, around refrigerator bases, and near droppings.
6. Focus on cracks, crevices, and pipe entry points.
7. Reapply every 3-4 days for active problems, or weekly as prevention. Shake before each use.

## Why It Works

Cypress oil's alpha-pinene interferes with cockroach neurotransmitter signaling, with repellency rates above 90% in lab tests. Peppermint's menthol irritates roach breathing pores. Cedar's thujone disrupts aggregation pheromones. Castile soap suffocates on direct contact by blocking spiracles.

## Tips

- Combine with sanitation: fix leaky pipes, wipe counters nightly, store food in sealed containers.
- Spray evenings when roaches are most active.
- For severe infestations, pair with boric acid baits for population control.
- Substitute rosemary oil if cypress is unavailable.
