## Steps

1. Pour the red wine into a small jar, ramekin, or shallow bowl.
2. Add the apple cider vinegar and sugar. Stir gently until the sugar dissolves.
3. Add 3 drops of dish soap and stir once. Avoid creating foam.
4. Place the trap near the source of the infestation: typically the fruit bowl, compost container, trash can, or kitchen sink drain.
5. For a funnel-style trap, cover the jar with plastic wrap, secure with a rubber band, and poke 4 to 6 small holes with a toothpick.
6. Alternatively, leave the trap uncovered for faster results. The dish soap eliminates the need for a physical barrier.
7. Replace the bait every 2 to 3 days or when the surface becomes covered with captured flies.

## Why It Works

Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are attracted to the ethanol and acetic acid produced during fruit fermentation because these compounds signal the presence of yeast, which is their primary food source. Red wine is essentially a concentrated source of both: it contains 12 to 15 percent ethanol and traces of acetic acid from the winemaking process. The residual sugars in wine further mimic overripe fruit. Apple cider vinegar amplifies the acetic acid component, and the added sugar provides fuel for continued low-level fermentation in the trap, producing a steady stream of attractant vapors. The dish soap is the lethal component. At just 3 drops, it reduces the liquid's surface tension below the threshold that a fruit fly's body weight can support. Fruit flies that land on the liquid to feed break through the surface and drown, unable to escape. Without the soap, most flies would simply drink and fly away.

## Tips

- Stale or oxidized wine that has been open for days is more effective than fresh wine because it has higher acetic acid content.
- If you do not drink wine, substitute 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar with 1 tablespoon of sugar. It is nearly as effective.
- Fruit fly infestations start in drains and garbage disposals. Pour boiling water down kitchen drains daily to kill larvae at the source.
- Remove the actual attractant: store ripe bananas, tomatoes, and stone fruit in the refrigerator until the infestation is under control.
- In a severe outbreak, place 3 to 4 traps in different kitchen locations. Fruit flies have a range of only about 6 feet from their food source.
