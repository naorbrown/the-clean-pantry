## Steps

1. Place 2 cotton balls into each muslin bag.
2. Add 5 drops peppermint, 2-3 drops clove, and 2-3 drops eucalyptus oil to each sachet.
3. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of cayenne flakes into each sachet.
4. Tie closed securely with twine or rubber bands.
5. Place at rodent entry points: pipe gaps, basement vents, garage corners, attic hatches, and along walls with droppings.
6. Refresh oils every 7-10 days by adding 5 drops of peppermint.
7. Replace sachets entirely every 4-6 weeks.

## Why It Works

Peppermint's menthol triggers a burning sensation in rodent nasal passages. Clove's eugenol is directly aversive. Eucalyptus's cineole causes respiratory irritation. Cayenne's capsaicin activates pain receptors in any rodent that chews the sachet. Four irritants create a multi-layered sensory barrier.

## Tips

- Focus on entry points. Seal gaps larger than 1/4 inch with steel wool and place a sachet nearby.
- These deter rodents but cannot solve an active infestation — traps are needed if you find droppings daily.
- For vehicles in storage, place 2 sachets under the hood near wiring harnesses.
- Combine with good sanitation. Remove pet food, birdseed, and any food sources that attract rodents.
