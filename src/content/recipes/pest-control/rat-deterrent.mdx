## Steps

1. Place 2 cotton balls into each muslin bag or cheesecloth square.
2. Add 5 drops of peppermint oil, 2 to 3 drops of clove oil, and 2 to 3 drops of eucalyptus oil to each sachet's cotton balls.
3. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of dried cayenne pepper flakes into each sachet.
4. Tie the sachets closed securely with twine or rubber bands.
5. Place sachets at known or suspected rodent entry points: gaps around pipes, basement vents, garage corners, attic hatches, and along walls where droppings have been found.
6. Refresh the essential oils by adding 5 drops of peppermint oil to each sachet every 7 to 10 days.
7. Replace the sachets entirely every 4 to 6 weeks or when the scent has faded despite refreshing.

## Why It Works

Rodents rely heavily on their sense of smell to navigate, find food, and detect danger. Their olfactory system is far more sensitive than humans', with roughly 1,200 olfactory receptor genes compared to our 400. Peppermint oil's menthol triggers intense stimulation of the trigeminal nerve in rodents, producing a burning sensation in their nasal passages that they find intolerable. Clove oil contains eugenol, which research has shown to be directly aversive to rodents, causing them to avoid treated areas entirely. Eucalyptus oil adds cineole, another compound that causes respiratory irritation in rodents at concentrations that are barely perceptible to humans. Cayenne pepper provides capsaicin, which activates pain receptors (TRPV1 channels) in any rodent that chews or noses the sachet. Together, these four irritants create a multi-layered sensory barrier that rodents learn to avoid.

## Tips

- Focus on entry points rather than scattering sachets randomly. Seal gaps larger than 1/4 inch with steel wool and place a sachet nearby for double protection.
- These sachets deter rodents but cannot solve an active infestation. If you are finding droppings daily, you need traps in addition to deterrents.
- Peppermint oil loses potency quickly when exposed to air. Buy small bottles and store them in a cool, dark place.
- For vehicles in storage, place 2 sachets under the hood near wiring harnesses, which rodents commonly chew.
- In a garage or shed, combine sachets with good sanitation. Remove pet food, birdseed, and any food sources that attract rodents in the first place.
