## Steps

1. Pour the apple cider vinegar into a wide-mouth jar or shallow bowl.
2. Add the warm water and stir in the sugar until dissolved. Warm water helps release the vinegar's aroma.
3. Add 3 drops of dish soap and stir gently. Do not create foam.
4. Drop in a small piece of overripe fruit if available for extra attraction.
5. Cover the jar opening with plastic wrap and secure with a rubber band. Poke 5 to 8 small holes in the plastic with a toothpick or fork tine.
6. Place the trap near areas where flies congregate: near trash cans, fruit bowls, windows, or kitchen counters.
7. Check the trap daily. Replace the bait solution every 3 to 4 days or when the liquid becomes cloudy with caught flies.

## Why It Works

House flies and many other fly species locate food through chemoreception, detecting airborne volatile organic compounds from fermenting organic matter. Apple cider vinegar produces acetic acid and ethanol vapors that mimic the scent profile of rotting fruit, which is irresistible to flies. The sugar boosts ethanol production and sweetens the scent, drawing flies from a wider radius. The critical ingredient is the dish soap: it contains surfactants that reduce the surface tension of the liquid from about 72 millinewtons per meter to below 30. Without surface tension, flies that land on the liquid cannot stand on its surface and sink immediately. The plastic wrap with small holes exploits flies' behavior of flying toward a scent source but being unable to navigate back out of small openings.

## Tips

- Apple cider vinegar works far better than white vinegar because it contains residual sugars and fruit esters that flies detect.
- Place multiple traps in different locations for a severe infestation rather than one large trap.
- If you do not have plastic wrap, a paper cone inserted into the jar opening works the same way. Roll paper into a funnel shape and tape it in place.
- In warm weather, the trap is more effective because heat increases the evaporation rate of the volatile attractants.
- For outdoor use, skip the plastic wrap and use a larger bowl. Outdoor flies are less cautious than indoor ones.
