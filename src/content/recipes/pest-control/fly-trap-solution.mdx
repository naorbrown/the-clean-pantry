## Steps

1. Pour apple cider vinegar into a wide-mouth jar or shallow bowl.
2. Add warm water and stir in sugar until dissolved.
3. Add 3 drops of dish soap and stir gently. Do not create foam.
4. Drop in a small piece of overripe fruit if available.
5. Cover the jar with plastic wrap and secure with a rubber band. Poke 5-8 small holes with a toothpick.
6. Place near flies: trash cans, fruit bowls, windows, or kitchen counters.
7. Replace bait every 3-4 days or when the liquid becomes cloudy.

## Why It Works

Apple cider vinegar produces acetic acid and ethanol vapors that mimic rotting fruit. Sugar boosts the scent. Dish soap breaks surface tension so flies sink on contact. Plastic wrap with holes exploits flies' inability to navigate back out.

## Tips

- Place multiple traps in different locations for severe infestations.
- A paper cone inserted into the jar works if you do not have plastic wrap.
- Traps are more effective in warm weather due to increased evaporation of attractants.
- For outdoor use, skip the plastic wrap and use a larger bowl.
