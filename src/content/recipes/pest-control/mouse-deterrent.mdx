## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of water into a 16 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.
3. Add 30 drops of pure peppermint essential oil. The concentration needs to be strong — mice have sensitive noses, but the scent must be potent enough to be genuinely unpleasant to them.
4. Cap and shake vigorously before each use.
5. Spray generously along baseboards, around door frames, near any gaps where pipes or wires enter the house, behind appliances, and in cabinet corners. Focus on known entry points and areas where you have seen droppings.
6. For sachets, place 5-6 drops of peppermint oil on each cotton ball and tuck them into the back corners of cabinets, drawers, and closets. Alternatively, fill small muslin bags with dried peppermint leaves and add 3-4 drops of oil to each sachet.
7. Refresh the spray and cotton balls every 5-7 days. The essential oil evaporates over time and loses its deterrent potency.

## Why It Works

Mice have an extremely sensitive sense of smell -- roughly 14 times more acute than a human's. Peppermint oil contains high concentrations of menthol and menthone, which are intensely irritating to a mouse's nasal passages at close range. The scent overwhelms their olfactory system and makes treated areas uncomfortable to occupy or pass through. Mice naturally avoid strong mint scent when they have alternative routes available.

The vinegar improves adhesion to surfaces, helping the peppermint scent persist longer on baseboards and gaps rather than evaporating immediately into the room air.

## Alternative

For outdoor perimeter deterrence, plant mint around the foundation of your home, particularly near doors and known entry points. Mint spreads aggressively, so plant it in containers or a defined bed to keep it controlled. Fresh mint plants provide a continuous source of the scent that mice avoid, and you get the bonus of fresh mint for cooking and tea.
## Tips

- Peppermint deterrent works best as a preventive measure and for minor mouse activity. A serious infestation (multiple mice, frequent droppings in many locations) requires sealing all entry points and may require professional help.
- Identify and seal entry points first. Mice can fit through gaps as small as 1/4 inch. Use steel wool packed into gaps (mice cannot chew through it) and seal over with caulk. The peppermint spray then discourages mice from seeking new entry points.
- Place cotton balls directly inside the gaps you have sealed as an extra layer of deterrence behind the steel wool.
- Use glass spray bottles, not plastic. Peppermint oil degrades some plastics over time.
- Clove essential oil and cayenne pepper are also mild mouse deterrents and can be added to the spray (10 drops clove oil or 1 teaspoon cayenne) for a stronger formula.
