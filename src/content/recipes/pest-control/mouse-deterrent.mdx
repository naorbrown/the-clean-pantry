## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of water into a 16 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.
3. Add 30 drops of pure peppermint essential oil.
4. Cap and shake vigorously before each use.
5. Spray along baseboards, door frames, pipe entry points, behind appliances, and in cabinet corners.
6. For sachets, place 5-6 drops of peppermint oil on each cotton ball and tuck into cabinets, drawers, and closets.
7. Refresh spray and cotton balls every 5-7 days.

## Why It Works

Mice have roughly 14x more acute sense of smell than humans. Peppermint's menthol and menthone irritate their nasal passages intensely, making treated areas uncomfortable. Vinegar improves surface adhesion so the scent persists longer.

## Alternative

Plant mint around your home's foundation near doors and entry points. Mint provides continuous scent that mice avoid, plus fresh mint for cooking.

## Tips

- Best as a preventive measure. Serious infestations need sealed entry points and may require professional help.
- Seal gaps with steel wool (mice cannot chew through it) and place cotton balls inside as backup.
- Use glass spray bottles — peppermint oil degrades some plastics.
- Add 10 drops of clove oil or 1 teaspoon cayenne for a stronger formula.
