## Steps

1. Pour the water and white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the castile soap and swirl gently to combine.
3. Add the peppermint and tea tree essential oil drops.
4. Cap the bottle and shake vigorously for 15 seconds to emulsify the oils.
5. Spray liberally along ant trails, entry points, baseboards, window sills, and doorframes where ants have been observed.
6. Reapply every 2 to 3 days or after rain for outdoor applications.
7. For preventive use, spray around the exterior perimeter of your home, focusing on foundation cracks, utility entry points, and where concrete meets siding.

## Why It Works

Ants navigate using pheromone trails -- chemical signals laid down by scout ants that guide the colony's foragers to food sources. Peppermint oil contains menthol and menthone, which are overwhelming to ants' antennal chemoreceptors, effectively blinding their ability to detect pheromone trails. Without trail pheromones, foraging ants become disoriented and cannot communicate the path back to a food source to the colony. White vinegar amplifies this effect because acetic acid destroys the pheromone molecules themselves, erasing the chemical trail rather than just masking it. Tea tree oil adds terpinen-4-ol, a compound that is directly repellent to ants and has been shown in studies to reduce ant foraging activity by over 80 percent. The castile soap emulsifies the essential oils into the water so they distribute evenly when sprayed rather than floating as droplets on top.

## Tips

- Shake the bottle before every use. Essential oils and water separate quickly.
- Identify and spray the specific entry point rather than spraying broad areas. Follow the ant trail backward to find where they are entering.
- This spray deters ants but does not kill the colony. For colony elimination, pair it with the Homemade Ant Bait recipe.
- Reapply after mopping or cleaning the sprayed areas, as the oils will be wiped away.
- Add 10 drops of cinnamon bark essential oil for even stronger repellent action. Cinnamaldehyde is one of the most potent natural ant deterrents.
