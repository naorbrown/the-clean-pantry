## Steps

1. Pour water and white vinegar into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add castile soap and swirl gently.
3. Add peppermint and tea tree essential oils.
4. Cap and shake vigorously for 15 seconds.
5. Spray along ant trails, entry points, baseboards, window sills, and doorframes.
6. Reapply every 2-3 days or after rain for outdoor use.
7. For prevention, spray the exterior perimeter focusing on foundation cracks and utility entry points.

## Why It Works

Peppermint's menthol overwhelms ants' chemoreceptors, blinding their ability to follow pheromone trails. Vinegar's acetic acid destroys the pheromone molecules themselves. Tea tree's terpinen-4-ol is directly repellent to ants. Castile soap emulsifies the oils for even distribution.

## Tips

- Shake before every use. Essential oils and water separate quickly.
- Follow the ant trail backward to find the entry point and spray there.
- This deters ants but does not kill the colony. Pair with the Homemade Ant Bait for colony elimination.
- Add 10 drops of cinnamon bark oil for stronger repellent action.
