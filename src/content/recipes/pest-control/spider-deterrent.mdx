## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 20 drops of peppermint essential oil (Mentha piperita, not fragrance oil).
4. Add 3 drops of plant-based dish soap as an emulsifier.
5. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds.
6. Spray along baseboards, door frames, window sills, corners, and any cracks or gaps.
7. Reapply weekly or after cleaning sprayed surfaces.

## Why It Works

Menthol overwhelms spiders' leg-hair sensory organs, interfering with their ability to sense their environment. Vinegar's acetic acid creates an inhospitable surface. Dish soap emulsifies the oil for even distribution.

## Alternative

Tea tree oil (10 drops) or eucalyptus oil (15 drops) also repel spiders. Both are also toxic to cats.

## Tips

- Remove existing webs before spraying. Spiders rebuild in familiar spots despite repellent.
- Spray exterior doorways and window frames too for an outer barrier. Reapply after rain.
- For garages and basements, increase peppermint oil to 40 drops per batch.
- Cat owners: use a 1:1 vinegar and water spray instead (no essential oils).
