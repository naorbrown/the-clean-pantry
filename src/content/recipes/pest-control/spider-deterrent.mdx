## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add 20 drops of peppermint essential oil. Use true peppermint oil (Mentha piperita), not peppermint fragrance oil, which lacks the active compounds.
4. Add 3 drops of plant-based liquid dish soap. The soap acts as an emulsifier, preventing the oil from floating on top of the water.
5. Screw on the spray top and shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds.
6. Spray along baseboards, around door frames, window sills, in corners where webs tend to appear, and along any cracks or gaps where spiders might enter. Focus on areas where you have seen spiders or webs before.
7. Reapply once a week, or after cleaning the sprayed surfaces.

## Why It Works

Spiders navigate and detect prey primarily through chemical and vibration cues on their leg hairs (setae). Menthol, the primary compound in peppermint oil, overwhelms these sensory organs. Spiders actively avoid areas with high menthol concentrations because the compound interferes with their ability to sense their environment.

The vinegar adds a secondary repellent effect. Its acetic acid creates an inhospitable surface that spiders prefer to avoid. Together, the peppermint and vinegar create a chemical barrier that discourages spiders from crossing treated thresholds.

The dish soap serves a practical purpose -- it breaks the surface tension of the water, allowing the peppermint oil to mix evenly throughout the solution instead of pooling on top. This ensures consistent distribution when sprayed.

## Tips

- **Focus on entry points.** Spiders come inside through gaps around doors, windows, utility pipes, and foundation cracks. These are the most effective places to spray. Treating the middle of a wall does little.
- **Remove existing webs first.** Clear any webs before spraying. A spider will rebuild a web in a familiar spot despite the repellent. Removing the web forces it to relocate, and the peppermint scent discourages it from returning to the same area.
- **Outdoor application.** Spray around the exterior of doorways and window frames as well. This creates an outer barrier that reduces the number of spiders reaching your interior entry points. Reapply after rain.
- **Strengthen the mix for garages and basements.** For unfinished spaces where you do not mind a strong scent, increase the peppermint oil to 40 drops per batch.
- **Cat warning.** Peppermint essential oil contains menthol and menthone, which are toxic to cats. Cats lack the liver enzymes to metabolize these compounds. If you have cats, use a vinegar-only spray (1:1 vinegar and water) instead.

## Alternative

If you do not have peppermint oil, tea tree oil (10 drops) or eucalyptus oil (15 drops) also repel spiders. Tea tree is slightly less effective than peppermint for this purpose but has the advantage of also deterring other insects. Note that both tea tree and eucalyptus are also toxic to cats.
