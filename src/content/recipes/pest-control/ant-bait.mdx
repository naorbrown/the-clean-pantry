## Steps

1. Dissolve 2 tablespoons of sugar in 1 cup of warm water.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of borax and stir until combined.
3. Soak cotton balls in the mixture until saturated.
4. Place soaked cotton balls in shallow containers near ant trails and entry points.
5. Refresh the bait every few days or when the cotton balls dry out.

## Why It Works

Ants carry the borax-laced sugar solution back to the colony via trophallaxis. Over days, the borax disrupts digestive systems throughout the colony, eliminating it at the source.

## Alternative

Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth along entry points and ant trails. Its microscopic edges damage ant exoskeletons, causing dehydration. Safe around children and pets but must be reapplied after moisture.

## Tips

- Be patient. More ants initially means scouts are recruiting others to the bait.
- Do not kill visible ants — you want them to carry bait back to the nest.
- Place stations along walls and in corners where trails are visible.
