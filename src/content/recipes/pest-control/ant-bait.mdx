## How to Make It

1. Dissolve 2 tablespoons of sugar in 1 cup of warm water, stirring until fully dissolved.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of borax and stir until combined. The solution should be clear.
3. Soak cotton balls in the mixture until saturated.
4. Place the soaked cotton balls in shallow containers (jar lids work well) near ant trails, entry points, and anywhere you've spotted activity.
5. Refresh the bait every few days or when the cotton balls dry out.

## Why It Works

Ants are attracted to the sugar and carry the borax-laced solution back to the colony. Worker ants share the bait with the queen and other colony members through a process called trophallaxis. Over the course of a few days to a week, the borax disrupts the digestive systems of the ants throughout the colony, eliminating it at the source rather than just killing individual foragers.

## Tips

- Be patient. You may see more ants initially as scouts recruit others to the bait. This is a good sign.
- Do not kill the ants you see — you want them to carry the bait back to the nest.
- Place bait stations along walls and in corners where ant trails are visible.

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer a non-toxic option, sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth along entry points and ant trails. The microscopic sharp edges damage the ants' exoskeletons, causing dehydration. Diatomaceous earth is safe around children and pets but must be reapplied after it gets wet.
