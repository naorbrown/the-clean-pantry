## Steps

1. Remove oven racks from the oven. Place them in a bathtub, large utility sink, or a heavy-duty garbage bag laid in the tub.
2. If using a bathtub, line it with old towels first to protect the tub surface from scratching.
3. Fill the tub with enough hot water to fully submerge the racks. The water should be as hot as your tap produces.
4. Add 1/2 cup of washing soda, 1/4 cup of baking soda, 2 tablespoons of dish soap, and 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the water. Stir to dissolve.
5. Submerge the racks completely and let them soak for 8 to 12 hours, or overnight. The soaking time is what does the heavy lifting.
6. After soaking, scrub each rack with a non-scratch scrub pad or stiff brush. The baked-on grease should lift away with minimal effort. For stubborn spots, make a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the spot, wait 15 minutes, and scrub again.
7. Rinse the racks thoroughly with clean water. Dry completely before returning them to the oven to prevent flash rusting.

## Why It Works

Baked-on oven grease is polymerized fat — cooking oils that have bonded to the metal surface through repeated heating. Washing soda (sodium carbonate, pH 11.6) is a powerful alkaline cleaner that saponifies these fats, chemically converting them from insoluble grease into water-soluble soap that dissolves into the soaking water. The extended soak time allows the alkaline solution to slowly penetrate and break down multiple layers of carbonized grease. Dish soap adds surfactant action that helps the water penetrate the grease layer faster. Baking soda provides additional alkalinity, and vinegar helps dissolve any mineral scale that may be trapping grease deposits.

## Tips

- The garbage bag method works well if you do not want to use your bathtub. Place racks in a large trash bag, add the solution, seal the bag, and lay it flat in the tub overnight.
- For extremely neglected racks with thick carbon buildup, soak for a full 24 hours and refresh the solution halfway through.
- Dryer sheets added to the soak can help — the fabric softener agents further loosen baked-on residue. Add 4 to 6 sheets.
- To prevent future buildup, place a sheet of aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch drips, and wipe racks with a damp cloth after each oven use while they are still warm.
