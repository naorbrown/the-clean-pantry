## Steps

1. **For surface rust stains (sinks, tubs, tools):** Squeeze lemon juice directly onto the rusted area until it is fully saturated.
2. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of table salt over the lemon juice. The salt acts as a gentle abrasive.
3. Let the mixture sit for 2 to 3 hours. For light surface rust, 30 minutes may be sufficient.
4. Scrub the area with a stiff brush, scouring pad, or crumpled aluminum foil. The combination of acid and abrasion will lift the rust.
5. Rinse thoroughly with water and dry the surface completely to prevent new rust from forming.
6. **For small rusted objects (bolts, tools, hardware):** Submerge them in a bowl of undiluted white vinegar for 2 to 4 hours, or overnight for heavy rust.
7. Remove the objects, scrub off loosened rust with a brush, rinse, and dry immediately.

## Why It Works

Rust is iron oxide, formed when iron reacts with oxygen and moisture. Citric acid in lemon juice and acetic acid in vinegar both react chemically with iron oxide, converting it into iron citrate or iron acetate — soluble compounds that dissolve in water and can be wiped away. Salt provides gentle mechanical abrasion that breaks up the rust layer, exposing fresh surface area to the acid and speeding up the chemical reaction. This is the same principle behind commercial rust removers, but with food-safe acids.

## Tips

- Dry the metal surface completely after treatment. Leaving moisture on bare metal invites rust to return within hours.
- For rust stains on clothing, soak the stained area in lemon juice and lay it in direct sunlight for 1 to 2 hours before washing. The UV light accelerates the bleaching action of citric acid.
- On porcelain sinks and tubs, lemon juice and salt work well without risk of scratching. Avoid steel wool on porcelain surfaces.
- Coat cleaned metal tools with a thin layer of mineral oil or food-grade wax after treatment to create a moisture barrier.
- Do not use this method on aluminum — acid corrodes aluminum rapidly. Avoid brass and bronze as well, since acid strips their protective patina.

## Alternative

- Make a paste of cream of tartar (tartaric acid) and water. Apply it to the rust stain, wait 1 hour, and scrub. Cream of tartar is a milder acid that works well on light rust.
- For very heavy rust on cast iron, create a 50/50 solution of white vinegar and water and soak the item for 12 to 24 hours. Follow with a thorough scrub using steel wool, then re-season the cast iron immediately.
