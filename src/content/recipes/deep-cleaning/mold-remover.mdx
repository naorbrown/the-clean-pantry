## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of undiluted white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil. Cap the bottle and shake well to combine.
3. Spray the solution generously onto the moldy area, saturating the surface completely.
4. Let it sit for at least 1 hour. For heavy mold growth, leave it for 2 to 3 hours or overnight.
5. Scrub the area with a stiff brush or old toothbrush to remove the mold.
6. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Do not rinse the area — the residual vinegar and tea tree oil help prevent regrowth.
7. For persistent mold, repeat the application daily for 3 to 5 days.

## Why It Works

White vinegar contains roughly 5% acetic acid, which penetrates the cell structure of most common household molds and kills them. Research has shown that vinegar is effective against approximately 82% of mold species. Tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound with strong antifungal properties that kills mold spores and inhibits regrowth. Using undiluted vinegar maximizes the acetic acid concentration, which is important because mold is more resistant than common bacteria.

## Alternative

- For a stronger treatment on tile and grout, make a paste of baking soda and vinegar. Apply it to the moldy area, let it fizz and sit for 30 minutes, then scrub and rinse.
- Hydrogen peroxide (3%) can be used instead of vinegar. Spray it on undiluted, wait 10 minutes, and scrub. It is safe for most surfaces and has no strong odor.
## Tips

- Do not dilute the vinegar. Mold requires a higher acid concentration to kill than regular surface bacteria, so full-strength vinegar is necessary.
- The vinegar smell is strong but dissipates within a few hours. Open windows and run fans to speed up the process.
- Tea tree oil has a medicinal scent that also fades over time. If you dislike the smell, you can substitute 15 drops of clove essential oil, which has similar antifungal properties.
- This spray works on non-porous surfaces like tile, glass, sealed countertops, and painted walls. For mold on drywall or unsealed wood, the mold may have penetrated too deeply for a surface treatment — consult a professional.
- Shake the bottle before each use, as tea tree oil and vinegar separate when sitting.
- After removing mold, address the root cause (excess moisture, poor ventilation) to prevent it from returning.
