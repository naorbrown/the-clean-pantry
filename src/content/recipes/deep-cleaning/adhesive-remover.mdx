## Steps

1. Peel off as much of the sticker or label as possible by hand. Use a plastic scraper or the edge of a credit card to lift stubborn edges without scratching the surface.
2. In a small dish, mix 1 tablespoon of coconut oil with 1 tablespoon of baking soda to form a thick paste.
3. Apply the paste generously over the adhesive residue, covering it completely.
4. Let the paste sit for 10 to 15 minutes. The oil needs time to penetrate and break down the adhesive.
5. Rub the area in small circles with your fingers, a soft cloth, or a non-scratch scouring pad. You should feel the adhesive balling up and lifting away.
6. Wipe the area clean with a damp cloth.
7. If the surface is glass or non-porous, follow up with a spray of vinegar and a wipe to remove any oily residue.

## Why It Works

Most adhesives used on consumer labels and stickers are pressure-sensitive adhesives made from synthetic polymers. These polymers are designed to be resistant to water but dissolve readily in oils. Coconut oil penetrates the adhesive film and weakens the bond between the glue and the surface by breaking apart the polymer chains. Baking soda adds a fine abrasive texture that helps physically scrub away softened adhesive without scratching most surfaces. Together, they replicate what commercial products like Goo Gone do, but with food-safe ingredients.

## Alternative

- For large areas of adhesive (such as old shelf liner residue), warm the adhesive with a hair dryer on medium heat for 30 seconds, then apply the oil paste. Heat softens the adhesive and makes it much easier to remove.
- White vinegar alone can remove light adhesive residue from glass and metal. Soak a cloth in vinegar, press it against the residue for 5 minutes, and scrub.
## Tips

- If you do not have coconut oil, any cooking oil works — olive oil, vegetable oil, or even mayonnaise (which is mostly oil). Coconut oil is simply the easiest to work with because it is semi-solid at room temperature and stays in place.
- For adhesive on glass (such as jar labels), soak the item in warm soapy water for 10 minutes first. This softens paper-based labels and makes removal much faster.
- On plastic containers, coconut oil is safe and effective. Avoid using citrus-based solvents on plastic, as they can cloud or damage the surface.
- For adhesive on painted walls, use only the oil without baking soda to avoid scuffing the paint. Apply oil with a cotton ball, wait 5 minutes, and gently rub.
- Rubbing alcohol also works well on non-porous surfaces if you prefer a residue-free option. Apply it with a cotton ball and scrub gently.
