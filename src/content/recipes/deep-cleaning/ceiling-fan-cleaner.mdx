## Steps

1. Turn off the ceiling fan at the wall switch and wait until the blades have completely stopped. For extra safety, turn off the circuit breaker.
2. Lay a drop cloth or old sheet under the fan to catch falling dust.
3. In a spray bottle, combine 1/2 cup of white vinegar, 1 cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol. Shake gently.
4. Climb a sturdy step ladder so you can comfortably reach the fan blades. Slide a pillowcase over one blade at a time, then slowly pull the pillowcase off while gently pressing the fabric against the blade. This captures the dust inside the pillowcase instead of dropping it into the room.
5. After removing the heavy dust with the pillowcase, spray each blade with the cleaning solution. Wipe both the top and bottom surfaces of each blade with a microfiber cloth.
6. Clean the motor housing and pull chain with a damp cloth sprayed with the solution. Do not spray liquid directly into the motor housing.
7. Wipe all blades and the housing with a dry cloth. For a dust-repelling finish, rub a dryer sheet lightly over each blade — the anti-static coating helps repel dust.

## Why It Works

Ceiling fan blades accumulate a sticky film of dust because they generate static electricity as they spin through the air. This electrostatic charge attracts and holds dust particles that bond with airborne cooking grease and moisture to form a stubborn grimy layer. Vinegar cuts through the greasy binder holding the dust in place. Dish soap's surfactant properties emulsify the cooking grease film so it lifts away rather than smearing across the blade. Rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly, preventing moisture from pooling on the blade surface or dripping into the motor. The pillowcase technique works because the fabric traps dust particles through static and friction, preventing them from becoming airborne.

## Tips

- Clean ceiling fans monthly to prevent heavy dust buildup. Light, frequent cleaning is faster than infrequent deep cleaning.
- The pillowcase method is the single best technique for fan blade dusting. It prevents dust from falling onto furniture and bedding below.
- Kitchen ceiling fans accumulate grease faster than other rooms. Clean kitchen fans twice as often as bedroom fans.
- After cleaning, apply a thin coating of furniture polish or wipe with a dryer sheet to create an anti-static barrier that repels dust for weeks.
- If blades wobble after cleaning, check that all blades are dry and that no cleaning cloth residue is stuck to the motor housing.
