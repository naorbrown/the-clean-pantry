## Steps

1. Put on protective gloves, safety goggles, and an N95 respirator mask before handling mold. Mold spores can cause serious respiratory irritation.
2. Open all windows and doors in the area for maximum ventilation. Position a fan to blow air out of the room.
3. In a spray bottle, combine 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide, 1/2 cup of distilled water, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. The mixture will fizz briefly — wait until it settles.
4. Add 20 drops of tea tree essential oil, seal the bottle, and shake well.
5. Saturate the moldy surface thoroughly with the spray. Do not lightly mist — the surface should be visibly wet.
6. Let the spray sit on the mold for 20 to 30 minutes. Do not scrub during this time — the active ingredients need dwell time to kill the mold roots.
7. After the dwell time, scrub the area with a stiff brush to remove dead mold. Wipe clean with disposable paper towels and discard them in a sealed plastic bag.
8. Spray the cleaned area one more time and let it air dry. This second application provides residual protection against regrowth.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that kills mold by breaking down its cellular structure through the release of oxygen radicals. Unlike bleach, peroxide penetrates slightly into porous surfaces to attack mold roots (hyphae), not just the visible surface growth. Tea tree oil (melaleuca) contains terpinen-4-ol, a compound proven to disrupt fungal cell membranes and prevent spore germination. Vinegar's acetic acid kills approximately 82% of mold species by lowering the pH below what most fungi can survive. Baking soda raises the cleaning paste's abrasiveness slightly and helps deodorize the musty smell that mold produces through volatile organic compounds.

## Tips

- Never paint over mold. The mold will grow through the paint within weeks. Always kill and remove mold completely before refinishing.
- After remediation, address the moisture source that caused the mold — a leak, condensation, or poor ventilation. Mold returns within days if the underlying moisture problem is not fixed.
- Dispose of all cleaning materials (paper towels, gloves, brush) in a sealed bag to prevent spreading spores.
- This spray is most effective on non-porous surfaces like tile, glass, metal, and sealed countertops. For mold on drywall or wood, the affected material often needs to be removed and replaced.
