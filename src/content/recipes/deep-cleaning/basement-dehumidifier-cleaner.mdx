## Steps

1. Unplug the dehumidifier and wait at least 30 minutes for the compressor to cool and any residual charge to dissipate.
2. Remove the water collection bucket. Empty it and discard any standing water.
3. Fill the bucket with 2 cups of white vinegar and enough warm water to fill it halfway. Let it soak for 20 minutes. The vinegar dissolves mineral scale and kills mold and bacteria that thrive in the damp bucket.
4. While the bucket soaks, mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of dish soap and a splash of warm water to make a paste. Use this paste and a soft brush to scrub the air intake grille and any accessible exterior surfaces.
5. Remove and rinse the air filter under running water. If the filter has mold or mildew, soak it in a solution of 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide and 2 cups of warm water for 10 minutes, then rinse.
6. Scrub the inside of the water bucket with a bottle brush, paying attention to the corners and the float switch area where slime builds up. Rinse thoroughly.
7. Wipe all surfaces dry with a clean cloth. Reassemble the unit and allow all parts to air dry completely before plugging it back in.

## Why It Works

Dehumidifiers collect moisture from the air along with airborne mold spores, bacteria, and dust particles. The constantly wet bucket becomes an ideal breeding ground for microbial growth. Vinegar's acetic acid has a pH of 2.4, which is lethal to most mold species and dissolves the calcium carbonate scale that builds up from mineral-laden water. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes mold and biofilm on the filter media without leaving chemical residues that would become airborne when the unit runs. Baking soda provides gentle mechanical cleaning and neutralizes the musty odors that dehumidifiers can develop when they are not maintained regularly.

## Tips

- Clean your dehumidifier every 2 to 4 weeks during heavy use seasons. A dirty unit works harder, consumes more electricity, and can actually spread mold spores.
- If the bucket develops a pink or orange slime, that is Serratia marcescens bacteria — harmless but persistent. The vinegar soak kills it, but it will return if you skip cleanings.
- Run the unit in a well-ventilated area after cleaning to dry out internal components you cannot reach.
- Replace disposable filters according to the manufacturer's schedule. No amount of cleaning restores a degraded filter's effectiveness.
