## Steps

1. Empty the trash can completely. Remove the bag and shake out any loose debris.
2. Take the trash can outside or to a well-ventilated area. Rinse it with a garden hose or pour in a gallon of hot water to loosen stuck-on residue.
3. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of baking soda across the bottom and sides of the can. Let it sit for 5 minutes to begin neutralizing odors.
4. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into the can. The fizzing reaction will help loosen stuck-on grime and neutralize acidic odor compounds.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 10 drops of tea tree essential oil. Fill the can halfway with hot water.
6. Scrub the interior surfaces with a long-handled brush, paying special attention to the bottom and the rim where residue accumulates.
7. Empty the can and rinse thoroughly with clean water. Turn it upside down and let it air dry completely in the sun. Sunlight provides natural UV disinfection.

## Why It Works

Trash can odors come from volatile organic compounds produced by decomposing food waste and bacterial metabolism. Baking soda is amphoteric, neutralizing both the acidic compounds (fatty acids from decomposition) and alkaline compounds (ammonia from protein breakdown) that create the smell. Vinegar kills many common bacteria on contact through acid disruption of their cell membranes. Tea tree oil provides lasting antimicrobial protection — its terpinen-4-ol compound continues inhibiting bacterial growth on surfaces for days after application. Sunlight drying adds natural UV-C radiation exposure, which damages microbial DNA and provides an additional sanitization step.

## Tips

- For ongoing odor prevention, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda in the bottom of the can before inserting a new bag. The baking soda absorbs odors between cleanings.
- Deep clean trash cans monthly during summer when heat accelerates decomposition and odor buildup.
- Place a few cotton balls soaked with peppermint or eucalyptus oil at the bottom of the can under the bag. These scents also deter insects and rodents.
- If your trash can has a persistent maggot problem, the tea tree oil treatment is especially effective — tea tree oil is a proven insect larvicide.
