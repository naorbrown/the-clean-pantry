## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of distilled water into a clean 32 oz spray bottle. Distilled water prevents mineral spots that tap water can leave on laminate.
2. Add 1/4 cup of rubbing alcohol and 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
3. Add exactly 3 drops of liquid dish soap — no more. Excess soap creates a hazy film on laminate that attracts dirt.
4. Seal the bottle and shake gently to combine.
5. Spray a fine mist onto a 3-by-3-foot section of floor. Never pour liquid directly onto laminate — it can seep into seams and cause swelling.
6. Immediately wipe with a flat microfiber mop using straight strokes. The floor should feel barely damp as you work.
7. Move to the next section. The alcohol ensures rapid evaporation, so the floor dries within minutes with no streaks.

## Why It Works

Laminate flooring has a thin decorative photographic layer protected by a melamine resin wear layer. This surface is non-porous and does not absorb moisture — but it is extremely sensitive to residue buildup from traditional cleaners, which creates a dull haze over time. Rubbing alcohol is the key ingredient because it evaporates almost instantly, cleaning without leaving behind any moisture or film. Vinegar dissolves sticky spots and light mineral deposits. The tiny amount of dish soap provides just enough surfactant action to lift dirty footprints and kitchen grease without depositing a soapy residue. Distilled water ensures zero mineral content in the solution.

## Tips

- Never use a steam mop on laminate flooring. The heat and moisture can delaminate the layers and warp the planks permanently.
- Wring your mop pad until it is barely damp. Standing water is the number one enemy of laminate floors — it penetrates seams and causes irreversible swelling.
- For sticky spots like juice or candy residue, spray the spot directly and let it sit for 30 seconds before wiping.
- Do not use wax, polish, or oil-based products on laminate. They create buildup that is difficult to remove and dulls the finish.
- Place felt pads under furniture legs to prevent scratches when furniture is moved.
