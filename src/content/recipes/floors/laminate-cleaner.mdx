## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of distilled water into a 32 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/4 cup rubbing alcohol and 1/4 cup white vinegar.
3. Add exactly 3 drops of dish soap — no more.
4. Seal and shake gently to combine.
5. Spray a fine mist onto a 3-by-3-foot section. Never pour liquid directly onto laminate.
6. Wipe immediately with a flat microfiber mop. The floor should feel barely damp.
7. Move to the next section. The alcohol ensures rapid, streak-free drying.

## Why It Works

Laminate is non-porous but extremely sensitive to residue buildup, which creates a dull haze over time. Rubbing alcohol evaporates almost instantly, cleaning without leaving moisture or film. Vinegar dissolves sticky spots and mineral deposits. The tiny amount of dish soap lifts footprints and grease without soapy residue.

## Tips

- Never use a steam mop on laminate — heat and moisture warp planks permanently.
- Wring your mop pad until barely damp. Standing water penetrates seams and causes irreversible swelling.
- For sticky spots, spray directly and wait 30 seconds before wiping.
- Do not use wax, polish, or oil-based products on laminate.
