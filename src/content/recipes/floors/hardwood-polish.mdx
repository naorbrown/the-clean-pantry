## Steps

1. Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup white vinegar, and 1 cup warm water in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of lemon essential oil if desired.
3. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds to emulsify. Shake well before each use.
4. Mist a 3-by-3-foot section lightly.
5. Buff immediately with a dry microfiber cloth following the wood grain.
6. Continue section by section, flipping or replacing the pad as it saturates.
7. Allow 10 minutes to dry before walking on the floor.

## Why It Works

Olive oil fills micro-scratches in the polyurethane seal, creating a smoother, more reflective surface. Vinegar dissolves grime and hard water residue that dulls the finish. Warm water distributes the oil evenly and speeds evaporation so the floor does not stay slippery.

## Tips

- A light mist is all you need — excess oil attracts dust and creates a sticky film.
- Use monthly as maintenance, not as a daily cleaner.
- Buff immediately after spraying to avoid uneven shiny spots.
- Test in a closet first to confirm your floor's finish responds well.
