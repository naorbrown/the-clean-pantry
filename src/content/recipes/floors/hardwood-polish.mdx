## Steps

1. Combine 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/4 cup of white vinegar, and 1 cup of warm water in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops of lemon essential oil if desired. The lemon complements the vinegar scent and adds mild degreasing properties.
3. Shake the bottle vigorously for 15 seconds to emulsify the oil and water. The mixture will separate — always shake well before each use.
4. Mist a small section of floor lightly with the polish. Work in 3-by-3-foot sections to maintain even coverage.
5. Immediately buff the sprayed area with a dry microfiber cloth or mop pad using long, straight strokes following the wood grain direction.
6. Continue section by section across the room. Flip or replace the microfiber pad as it becomes saturated.
7. Allow the floor to dry for 10 minutes before walking on it. The floor will have a soft, natural sheen.

## Why It Works

Olive oil penetrates the micro-scratches and wear marks on polyurethane-sealed hardwood, filling them with oil and creating a smoother, more reflective surface. This is not a true furniture polish — it works by optical enhancement rather than building up a wax layer. Vinegar dissolves light grime and hard water residue that dulls the finish, restoring the original clarity of the polyurethane coating. The warm water helps distribute the oil evenly and speeds evaporation so the floor does not remain slippery. The result is a refreshed, gleaming floor that looks professionally maintained.

## Tips

- Less is more with this polish. A light mist is all you need — excess oil will attract dust and create a sticky film.
- Use this polish monthly as a maintenance treatment, not as a daily cleaner. For daily cleaning, use a damp microfiber mop with plain water.
- Always buff immediately after spraying. If the polish sits too long, it becomes harder to spread evenly and can leave uneven shiny spots.
- Test in a closet or under furniture first to ensure your floor's finish responds well.
- Do not use on laminate, vinyl, or tile floors — the oil serves no purpose on non-wood surfaces and will create a slipping hazard.
