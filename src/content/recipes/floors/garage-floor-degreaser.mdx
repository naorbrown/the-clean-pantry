## Steps

1. Sweep the stained area thoroughly to remove loose dirt, dust, and debris.
2. In a bucket, combine 1 cup of baking soda, 1/4 cup of washing soda, 2 tablespoons of dish soap, and 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide. Add 1/2 cup of hot water and stir to form a thick paste.
3. For fresh oil stains, first absorb excess oil by covering the stain with cat litter or sawdust for 15 minutes, then sweep it up. For old stains, proceed directly.
4. Spread the paste thickly over the entire stain, extending 1 inch beyond the stain edges. Press the paste into the concrete surface.
5. Cover the paste with a sheet of plastic wrap to keep it moist. Let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes. For old, set-in stains, leave it for up to 2 hours.
6. Remove the plastic wrap. Scrub the area vigorously with a stiff-bristled deck brush or push broom.
7. Rinse the area with a garden hose or bucket of clean water. For stubborn stains, repeat the process a second time.

## Why It Works

Washing soda saponifies grease, converting oil into water-soluble soap that rinses away. Baking soda adds alkalinity and gentle abrasion. Dish soap emulsifies oil droplets so they lift out of concrete pores. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down the oxidized compounds that give old stains their dark appearance.

## Tips

- Treat fresh spills within 24 hours — they are far easier to remove.
- For deeply set stains, apply paste overnight under plastic wrap.
- After cleaning, apply a concrete sealer to prevent future oil absorption.
- Pressure washing after paste treatment flushes dissolved oil from concrete pores.
