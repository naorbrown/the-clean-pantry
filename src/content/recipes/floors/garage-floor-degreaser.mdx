## Steps

1. Sweep the stained area thoroughly to remove loose dirt, dust, and debris.
2. In a bucket, combine 1 cup of baking soda, 1/4 cup of washing soda, 2 tablespoons of dish soap, and 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide. Add 1/2 cup of hot water and stir to form a thick paste.
3. For fresh oil stains, first absorb excess oil by covering the stain with cat litter or sawdust for 15 minutes, then sweep it up. For old stains, proceed directly.
4. Spread the paste thickly over the entire stain, extending 1 inch beyond the stain edges. Press the paste into the concrete surface.
5. Cover the paste with a sheet of plastic wrap to keep it moist. Let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes. For old, set-in stains, leave it for up to 2 hours.
6. Remove the plastic wrap. Scrub the area vigorously with a stiff-bristled deck brush or push broom.
7. Rinse the area with a garden hose or bucket of clean water. For stubborn stains, repeat the process a second time.

## Why It Works

Concrete is highly porous, and motor oil seeps deep into its structure. Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is a strong alkaline cleaner with a pH of about 11 that saponifies grease — it chemically converts oil molecules into a water-soluble soap that can be rinsed away. Baking soda provides additional alkalinity plus gentle abrasion to scrub the concrete surface. Dish soap contributes surfactant action that emulsifies oil droplets, surrounding them so they lift away from the concrete pores rather than spreading. Hydrogen peroxide helps break down the darker-colored oxidized compounds in old oil stains that give them their stubborn dark appearance.

## Tips

- Fresh oil stains are dramatically easier to remove than old ones. Treat spills within 24 hours whenever possible.
- For very old, deeply set stains, apply the paste overnight under plastic wrap. The extended dwell time allows the cleaning agents to penetrate deeper into the concrete pores.
- After removing stains, consider applying a concrete sealer to prevent future oil absorption.
- Cat litter is the best first response to a fresh oil spill on concrete. Cover the spill, let it absorb for 20 minutes, sweep up, then apply this paste.
- Pressure washing after paste treatment improves results significantly — the high-pressure water flushes dissolved oil out of concrete pores.
