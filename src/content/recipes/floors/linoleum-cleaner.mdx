## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water (not hot — heat softens vinyl adhesive).
2. Add 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon dish soap, and 2 tablespoons rubbing alcohol. Stir gently.
3. Sweep or vacuum first to remove grit that causes fine scratches.
4. Dip a microfiber mop and wring until just damp.
5. Mop in even strokes from the far wall toward the door.
6. For scuff marks, rub baking soda on a damp cloth until the mark lifts. Rinse immediately.
7. Air dry or go over with a dry microfiber pad for a streak-free finish.

## Why It Works

Apple cider vinegar is less acidic than white vinegar, making it gentler on linoleum's linseed oil base while still dissolving residue and mineral deposits. Dish soap lifts greasy film. Rubbing alcohol cuts through sticky spots and speeds drying to reduce moisture exposure.

## Tips

- Avoid ammonia and washing soda on linoleum — they degrade the linseed oil binder, causing brittleness.
- For lost shine, rub a thin coat of jojoba oil onto clean, dry linoleum and buff lightly.
- Clean weekly to prevent dirt from grinding into the surface under foot traffic.
- Place mats at doorways and under pet water bowls.
