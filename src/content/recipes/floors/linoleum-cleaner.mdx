## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water. Water that is too hot can soften vinyl adhesive over time.
2. Add 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap, and 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol if desired. Stir gently.
3. Sweep or vacuum the floor first to remove loose dirt. Mopping over grit can cause fine scratches on vinyl and linoleum surfaces.
4. Dip a microfiber mop into the solution and wring until just damp. Excess water can seep under linoleum edges and loosen the adhesive.
5. Mop in smooth, even strokes, working from the far wall toward the door.
6. For scuff marks, apply a small amount of baking soda to a damp cloth and rub gently until the mark lifts. Rinse the area immediately.
7. Allow the floor to air dry or go over it with a dry microfiber pad for a streak-free finish. The rubbing alcohol accelerates drying.

## Why It Works

Apple cider vinegar is preferred over white vinegar for linoleum because it is slightly less acidic (pH 3.0 versus 2.4), making it gentler on linoleum's linseed oil-based composition while still effective at dissolving sticky residue and mineral deposits. Dish soap provides surfactant action to lift greasy film from the floor surface. The small amount of rubbing alcohol serves a dual purpose: it acts as a fast-evaporating solvent that cuts through sticky spots and it helps the floor dry faster, reducing the time moisture sits on the surface. This combination cleans effectively without leaving the waxy residue that builds up from commercial floor cleaners.

## Tips

- Avoid harsh alkaline cleaners (ammonia, washing soda) on linoleum — they degrade the linseed oil binder over time, causing the floor to become brittle and crack.
- If your linoleum has lost its shine, rub a thin coat of jojoba oil onto the clean, dry floor with a soft cloth. Buff lightly for a natural luster.
- For vinyl plank flooring with textured surfaces, use a microfiber mop rather than a flat sponge mop to reach into the texture grooves.
- Clean linoleum and vinyl floors weekly to prevent dirt from grinding into the surface under foot traffic.
- Place mats at doorways and under pet water bowls to protect these floors from the most common sources of damage.
