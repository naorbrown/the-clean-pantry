## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water. Hot water can thermal-shock cold stone, so use comfortably warm water.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap and 1/4 cup of rubbing alcohol. Stir gently to combine without creating excessive suds.
3. Dip a microfiber mop into the solution and wring it thoroughly. The mop should be damp, not wet. Standing water can penetrate natural stone pores and cause staining.
4. Mop the floor in sections, following the natural direction of the stone pattern. Use gentle, even strokes.
5. Rinse the mop in clean water after every two sections to avoid spreading dirty water across the floor.
6. Go over the floor once more with a mop dampened in plain warm water to remove any soap residue.
7. Dry the floor with clean, dry microfiber towels. Allowing natural stone to air dry can leave water marks, especially on polished surfaces.

## Why It Works

Natural stone floors like marble, slate, and travertine are composed of calcium carbonate or similar minerals that are highly sensitive to acids. Even mild acids like vinegar or citrus juice will etch and permanently dull these surfaces. Castile soap is made from plant oils and has a pH of approximately 8.9 — mildly alkaline and completely safe for stone. It acts as a gentle surfactant that lifts dirt without chemical attack on the mineral surface. Rubbing alcohol provides fast-evaporating cleaning power that cuts through greasy footprints and food residue. Because alcohol evaporates quickly, it minimizes the time moisture sits on the porous stone surface, reducing the risk of water damage.

## Tips

- Never use vinegar, lemon juice, or any commercial cleaner labeled as acidic on natural stone. Even diluted acids cause cumulative etching damage.
- Reseal natural stone floors every 1 to 2 years with a penetrating stone sealer. A properly sealed floor resists staining and is easier to clean.
- Blot spills immediately on stone floors — especially wine, coffee, and tomato sauce. These liquids can stain porous stone within minutes.
- Use door mats at entryways to trap sand and grit, which scratch polished stone surfaces underfoot.
- For honed or matte stone finishes, reduce the castile soap to 1 teaspoon per gallon to prevent any buildup.
