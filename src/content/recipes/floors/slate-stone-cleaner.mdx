## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm (not hot) water.
2. Add 1 tablespoon castile soap and 1/4 cup rubbing alcohol. Stir gently.
3. Dip a microfiber mop and wring thoroughly. The mop should be damp, not wet.
4. Mop in sections, following the stone pattern with gentle, even strokes.
5. Rinse the mop in clean water every two sections.
6. Go over the floor once more with a mop dampened in plain warm water to remove soap residue.
7. Dry with microfiber towels — air drying can leave water marks on polished stone.

## Why It Works

Natural stone is highly sensitive to acids — even vinegar or citrus juice will etch and permanently dull these surfaces. Castile soap is mildly alkaline (pH ~8.9) and safe for stone, lifting dirt without chemical attack. Rubbing alcohol cuts through greasy residue and evaporates quickly, minimizing moisture time on porous stone.

## Tips

- Never use acidic cleaners on natural stone — even diluted acids cause cumulative etching.
- Reseal stone floors every 1 to 2 years with a penetrating stone sealer.
- Blot spills immediately — wine, coffee, and tomato sauce stain porous stone within minutes.
- For honed or matte finishes, reduce castile soap to 1 teaspoon per gallon.
