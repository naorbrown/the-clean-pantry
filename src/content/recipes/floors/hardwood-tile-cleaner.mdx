## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water.
2. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar and stir.
3. If floors are particularly dirty, add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap and stir gently to avoid excess suds.
4. Dip your mop into the solution and wring it out thoroughly. The mop should be damp, not dripping.
5. Mop the floor in sections, working from the far end of the room toward the doorway.
6. For hardwood, dry each section with a clean towel immediately after mopping to prevent water damage.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's mild acidity cuts through grease and dissolves sticky residue without leaving a film behind. The warm water helps loosen dirt and grime from grout lines and surface pores. A small amount of castile soap adds surfactant action for heavier soil loads while still rinsing clean.

## Alternative

For a quick spot-clean without mixing a bucket, combine equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Mist a small area, wipe with a microfiber cloth, and buff dry. This is especially useful for kitchen tile between full mops.

## Tips

- Never use vinegar on natural stone floors (marble, travertine, limestone). The acid etches and dulls the surface. Use plain warm water and a pH-neutral stone cleaner instead.
- Microfiber mop pads pick up more dirt and leave less moisture than cotton string mops.
- For a pleasant scent, add 5-10 drops of lemon or orange essential oil to the bucket.
