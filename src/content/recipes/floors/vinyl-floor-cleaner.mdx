## Steps

1. Fill a bucket with 1 gallon of warm water (not hot — heat softens vinyl adhesive).
2. Add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and stir.
3. Add 1 teaspoon unscented castile soap. Stir gently to avoid excess suds.
4. For extra shine, add 1 tablespoon rubbing alcohol.
5. Dip a microfiber mop, wring thoroughly until damp, not wet.
6. Mop in sections from the far corner toward the door using overlapping strokes.
7. For scuff marks, apply undiluted castile soap to the mark, scrub gently, and rinse.
8. Air dry. No rinsing needed — this solution leaves no residue.

## Why It Works

Apple cider vinegar's mild acidity dissolves dirt and mineral deposits without stripping the protective finish on vinyl and linoleum. Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant that lifts grease and grime while rinsing clean -- it does not leave the sticky film that commercial floor cleaners often leave behind. The rubbing alcohol speeds evaporation, which reduces water exposure time and prevents streaking on glossy vinyl surfaces.

Unlike vinyl, linoleum is made from natural materials (linseed oil, cork dust, wood flour, and jute) and has a slightly porous surface. This solution is gentle enough that it cleans without degrading linoleum's linseed oil binder, which keeps the material flexible and water-resistant.

## Alternative

For a quick spray-and-wipe between full mops, combine 1 cup of water, 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. Mist a section, wipe with a microfiber cloth, and move on. This works well for kitchens where spills happen daily.
## Tips

- **Do not use white vinegar at full strength** on linoleum. Linoleum is more sensitive to strong acids than vinyl. The 1:16 ratio in this recipe (1 cup per gallon) is well within the safe range.
- **Avoid steam mops** on both vinyl and linoleum. The high heat can warp vinyl tiles, loosen adhesive, and dry out linoleum.
- **Skip the wax.** Modern vinyl floors have a factory-applied urethane finish and should never be waxed. Wax builds up, yellows, and attracts dirt. If your vinyl looks dull, it likely has wax buildup from a previous owner -- strip it with a mixture of 1 cup of ammonia per gallon of water (use in a well-ventilated space), then switch to this vinegar-based cleaner going forward.
- **Scuff mark trick.** For black scuff marks from shoes, rub a tennis ball or a pencil eraser directly on the mark. This removes most scuffs without any liquid.
- **Sweep or vacuum first.** Always dry-clean before mopping. Grit left on the floor acts like sandpaper under the mop and scratches the finish over time.
