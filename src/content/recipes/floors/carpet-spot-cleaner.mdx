## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 1 cup of warm water in a spray bottle. Shake gently to mix.
2. Blot the stain with a dry cloth to absorb as much of the spill as possible before applying the cleaner. For dried stains, skip to step 3.
3. Spray the solution generously onto the stained area. Saturate the carpet fibers without soaking the padding underneath.
4. Let the solution sit for 5 to 10 minutes. You may see the stain begin to lighten as the peroxide works.
5. Blot the area firmly with a clean white cloth, working from the outside of the stain toward the center to prevent spreading. Continue blotting with fresh sections of the cloth until no more color transfers.
6. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda over the damp area. The baking soda will absorb remaining moisture and odors. Let it sit until completely dry, about 1 to 2 hours.
7. Vacuum up the dried baking soda thoroughly.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that breaks apart the chromophore molecules responsible for visible stain color. When it contacts organic stain compounds — tannins from coffee and wine, proteins from food — it breaks the chemical bonds that make them colored, rendering them invisible. Dish soap is a surfactant that reduces surface tension, allowing the solution to penetrate deep into carpet fibers where the stain has settled. Vinegar helps dissolve alkaline stains and neutralizes odors. Baking soda in the final step adsorbs residual moisture and any remaining odor molecules through physical trapping.

## Tips

- Speed matters with carpet stains. Treat spills within 5 minutes whenever possible — fresh stains are dramatically easier to remove than dried ones.
- Always blot from the outside edge of the stain toward the center. Working outward pushes the stain deeper and wider into the carpet.
- For red wine stains specifically, apply salt immediately to absorb the liquid before using this cleaning solution.
- Keep a premixed bottle under the sink for emergencies. The solution stays effective for about 2 weeks.
- For pet urine stains, use an enzyme-based cleaner first to break down uric acid, then follow with this recipe for remaining discoloration.
