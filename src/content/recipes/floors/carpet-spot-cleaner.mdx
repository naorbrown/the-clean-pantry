## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, 1 teaspoon of dish soap, and 1 cup of warm water in a spray bottle. Shake gently to mix.
2. Blot the stain with a dry cloth to absorb as much of the spill as possible before applying the cleaner. For dried stains, skip to step 3.
3. Spray the solution generously onto the stained area. Saturate the carpet fibers without soaking the padding underneath.
4. Let the solution sit for 5 to 10 minutes. You may see the stain begin to lighten as the peroxide works.
5. Blot the area firmly with a clean white cloth, working from the outside of the stain toward the center to prevent spreading. Continue blotting with fresh sections of the cloth until no more color transfers.
6. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda over the damp area. The baking soda will absorb remaining moisture and odors. Let it sit until completely dry, about 1 to 2 hours.
7. Vacuum up the dried baking soda thoroughly.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes stain molecules, breaking the bonds that make them colored. Dish soap reduces surface tension so the solution penetrates deep into carpet fibers. Vinegar dissolves alkaline stains and neutralizes odors. Baking soda in the final step absorbs residual moisture and remaining odor.

## Tips

- Treat spills within 5 minutes — fresh stains are far easier to remove.
- For red wine, apply salt immediately to absorb the liquid before spraying.
- Keep a premixed bottle under the sink. The solution stays effective for about 2 weeks.
- For pet urine, use an enzyme cleaner first, then this recipe for remaining discoloration.
