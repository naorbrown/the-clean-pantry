## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of dried lavender (or 10 drops of lavender essential oil) in a bowl and mix well.
2. If using essential oil, break up any clumps with a fork so the oil distributes evenly through the powder.
3. Sprinkle the mixture liberally over the carpet, focusing on high-traffic areas and spots with noticeable odor.
4. Let it sit for at least 20-30 minutes. For deep odors, leave it for several hours or overnight.
5. Vacuum the carpet thoroughly, making two passes over each section to pick up all the powder.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is amphoteric, meaning it can neutralize both acidic and basic odor molecules rather than simply masking them. As it sits on the carpet, it absorbs moisture and volatile compounds trapped in the fibers. The dried lavender provides a natural, pleasant scent without synthetic fragrance chemicals.

## Alternative

For pet odor specifically, sprinkle plain baking soda on the carpet, then lightly mist the area with a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water. The fizzing reaction helps lift embedded odors from deep in the carpet pad. Blot dry and vacuum once the area is completely dry.

## Tips

- Store any unused freshener in an airtight jar. It keeps for several months.
- If you have pets, confirm your essential oil choice is pet-safe. Lavender is generally safe for dogs, but many essential oils are toxic to cats.
- For a shaker-style applicator, poke holes in the lid of a mason jar and use it to distribute the powder evenly.
