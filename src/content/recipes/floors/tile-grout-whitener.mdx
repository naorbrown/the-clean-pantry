## Steps

1. Sweep or vacuum the floor to remove loose dirt.
2. Mix 1 cup baking soda, 1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide, and 1 tablespoon dish soap into a thick paste. Add warm water by the tablespoon if too thick.
3. Apply along grout lines with a brush or squeeze bottle. Work in 4-by-4-foot sections.
4. Let sit 20 minutes. Cover with damp paper towels or plastic wrap to prevent drying.
5. Scrub with a stiff grout brush using short back-and-forth strokes.
6. Mop each section with clean warm water. Change water frequently.
7. Dry with towels or air dry. Repeat on any lines still discolored.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide penetrates porous grout and oxidizes embedded stains from mildew, food, and soil. Baking soda provides abrasion that dislodges trapped particles. Dish soap reduces surface tension, allowing the paste to flow into grout pores and lift grime.

## Tips

- Use a long-handled grout brush for large floor areas to save your knees.
- After whitening, apply a penetrating grout sealer — clean grout absorbs sealer best.
- Steam cleaning first loosens deep grime and complements this paste treatment.
- Schedule this deep clean twice a year.
