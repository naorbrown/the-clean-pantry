## Steps

1. Sweep or vacuum the floor thoroughly to remove loose dirt and debris. Cleaning solution works poorly on top of dry grime.
2. In a bowl, mix 1 cup of baking soda with 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of dish soap. Stir until a thick, consistent paste forms. Add warm water a tablespoon at a time if the paste is too thick to spread.
3. Apply the paste along grout lines using a grout brush, old toothbrush, or a squeeze bottle for precision. Work in 4-by-4-foot sections so the paste does not dry out before scrubbing.
4. Let the paste sit on the grout for 20 minutes. Cover treated areas with damp paper towels or plastic wrap to prevent the paste from drying prematurely.
5. Scrub each section of grout with a stiff-bristled grout brush. Use short, back-and-forth strokes along the grout line rather than circular motions for better results.
6. Mop the entire section with clean warm water to rinse away all paste residue. Change the mop water frequently.
7. Dry the floor with clean towels or allow it to air dry completely. Inspect the grout and repeat the process on any lines that still appear discolored.

## Why It Works

Floor grout absorbs more dirt than wall grout because it endures foot traffic, spills, and mopping residue daily. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxygen bleach that penetrates the porous cement surface of grout and oxidizes embedded organic stains from mildew, food spills, and tracked-in soil. Baking soda provides mechanical abrasion that physically dislodges particles trapped in the grout texture. Dish soap acts as a surfactant that reduces the surface tension of the cleaning paste, allowing it to flow into the grout pores and lift deeply embedded grime to the surface where it can be scrubbed away.

## Tips

- For large floor areas, use a long-handled grout brush to save your knees and back. They are available at most hardware stores for under ten dollars.
- After whitening, apply a penetrating grout sealer to protect grout from re-staining. Clean grout absorbs sealer more effectively, so this is the ideal time.
- Steam cleaning is an excellent complement to this recipe. Steam first to loosen deep grime, then apply the paste for whitening.
- Schedule this deep clean twice a year. Regular mopping with a pH-neutral cleaner between deep cleans will maintain the results.
