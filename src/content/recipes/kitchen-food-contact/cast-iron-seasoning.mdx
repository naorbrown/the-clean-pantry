## Steps

1. If the skillet has existing rust or damaged seasoning, scrub it with 2 tablespoons of coarse salt and a damp paper towel. The salt abrades rust without removing good seasoning. Rinse briefly under warm water.
2. Place the clean skillet on a burner over medium heat for 2-3 minutes to evaporate all moisture. Cast iron rusts quickly when wet, so the pan must be bone dry before oiling.
3. Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F (or the highest setting available). Place a sheet of aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch any drips.
4. Pour approximately 1/2 tablespoon of flaxseed oil onto a paper towel. Rub the oil over the entire skillet -- inside cooking surface, outside walls, bottom, and handle. Every surface needs coverage.
5. Using a clean, dry paper towel, wipe off as much oil as possible. The pan should look almost dry. This is critical -- too much oil creates a sticky, uneven coating. The goal is a microscopically thin layer.
6. Place the skillet upside down on the middle oven rack. Bake for 1 hour at 500 degrees F. The high heat causes the flaxseed oil to polymerize into a hard, glass-like coating.
7. Turn off the oven and let the skillet cool inside for at least 1 hour. Do not open the oven door -- gradual cooling prevents thermal shock that can warp the iron.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 two more times for a total of three seasoning layers. Each layer builds on the previous one, creating a progressively smoother and more non-stick surface.

## Why It Works

Cast iron seasoning is not a coating applied to the surface -- it is a chemical transformation of oil into a polymer. When oil is heated past its smoke point, the fatty acid chains break apart and recombine into a cross-linked polymer matrix that bonds to the iron at a molecular level. This polymer is essentially a thin layer of food-safe plastic that is harder and smoother than the original iron surface.

Flaxseed oil is ideal for seasoning because it is a drying oil with a high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid). Drying oils polymerize more completely than non-drying oils like olive or vegetable oil, producing a harder, more durable coating. This is the same chemistry that makes linseed oil (the non-food-grade form of flaxseed oil) the preferred medium for oil paintings that last centuries.

The wipe-off step is essential because thick oil layers do not polymerize evenly. Excess oil pools and creates sticky patches. A microscopically thin layer polymerizes uniformly, bonding tightly to the iron and to subsequent layers.

## Tips

- **Do not use soap after seasoning.** Mild dish soap is technically fine on well-seasoned cast iron, but it is unnecessary. Hot water and a stiff brush clean a properly seasoned pan. Soap can gradually thin the seasoning over time.
- **Cook fatty foods first.** After fresh seasoning, cook bacon, sausage, or other fatty foods for your first few meals. The rendered fat reinforces the seasoning layer with each use.
- **Never soak.** Standing water destroys seasoning and causes rust. Clean your skillet immediately after cooking and dry it on the burner.
- **Re-season annually.** Even with daily use, one full oven-seasoning session per year keeps the non-stick coating in top condition. You will notice when it is time -- food starts sticking where it previously slid.
