## Steps

1. If the skillet has rust or damaged seasoning, scrub with 2 tablespoons of coarse salt and a damp paper towel. Rinse briefly.
2. Place the skillet on a burner over medium heat for 2-3 minutes to evaporate all moisture.
3. Preheat oven to 500F. Place aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch drips.
4. Rub about 1/2 tablespoon of flaxseed oil over the entire skillet — inside, outside, bottom, and handle.
5. Wipe off as much oil as possible with a clean, dry paper towel. The pan should look almost dry.
6. Place the skillet upside down on the middle oven rack. Bake for 1 hour.
7. Turn off the oven and let the skillet cool inside for at least 1 hour. Do not open the door.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 two more times for a total of three seasoning layers.

## Why It Works

When oil is heated past its smoke point, the fatty acid chains recombine into a cross-linked polymer that bonds to the iron. This creates a hard, smooth, food-safe layer.

Flaxseed oil is a drying oil that polymerizes more completely than olive or vegetable oil, producing a harder, more durable coating.

Thin oil layers polymerize uniformly. Excess oil pools and creates sticky patches — that is why the wipe-off step is essential.

## Tips

- **Cook fatty foods first.** Bacon, sausage, or other fatty foods reinforce the seasoning layer.
- **Never soak.** Standing water destroys seasoning and causes rust. Clean immediately and dry on the burner.
- **Re-season annually.** You will notice when it is time — food starts sticking where it previously slid.
