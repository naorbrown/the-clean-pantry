## Steps

1. Rinse the blender jar immediately after use. If food has dried, soak in warm water for 5 minutes first.
2. Add 2 cups of warm water — enough to cover the blades but no more than halfway.
3. Add 1 tablespoon each of liquid dish soap and baking soda.
4. Drop in 4-5 ice cubes.
5. Cut half a lemon into quarters and add to the jar.
6. Secure the lid and blend on high for 30-45 seconds.
7. Pour out the mixture. Swirl 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in 1 cup of clean warm water to rinse out soap film.
8. Rinse thoroughly under running water. Invert to air dry. Clean the gasket separately if your model allows disassembly.

## Why It Works

Ice cubes shatter against the jar walls at high speed, scrubbing areas a sponge cannot reach through the narrow opening. Baking soda creates an alkaline environment that converts grease into water-soluble soap — effective against nut butter, avocado, and coconut milk residue. Lemon's citric acid sanitizes the blade assembly and neutralizes persistent garlic and onion odors.

## Tips

- **For food processor bowls.** Use the standard blade and pulse 10 times instead of blending continuously.
- **Stubborn garlic odor.** Repeat with extra baking soda and lemon. Garlic's sulfur compounds bond strongly to plastic.
- **Deep clean the gasket.** Remove monthly, soak in a baking soda solution for 10 minutes, and scrub with a small brush.
