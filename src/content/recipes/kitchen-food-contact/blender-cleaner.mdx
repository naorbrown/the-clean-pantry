## Steps

1. Rinse the blender jar immediately after use to prevent food from drying on. If food has already dried, fill with warm water and let it soak for 5 minutes first.
2. Add 2 cups of warm water to the blender jar. The water should cover the blades completely but fill no more than halfway.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid dish soap and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. The baking soda boosts the soap's degreasing power and helps neutralize strong odors from garlic, onion, or spices.
4. Drop in 4-5 ice cubes. The ice acts as a solid abrasive that the spinning blades fling against the jar walls, scrubbing areas that liquid alone cannot reach.
5. Cut half a lemon into quarters and add to the jar. The lemon provides citric acid for sanitizing and deodorizing while the rind adds additional scrubbing texture.
6. Secure the lid firmly and blend on high for 30-45 seconds. The combination of ice, lemon, and soapy water creates a powerful self-cleaning vortex.
7. Pour out the cleaning mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to 1 cup of clean warm water, pour it into the jar, and swirl to rinse. This vinegar rinse removes soap film.
8. Rinse the jar thoroughly under running water. Invert on a drying rack and allow to air dry completely. Remove and clean the gasket at the base of the jar separately if your model allows disassembly.

## Why It Works

Blender jars present a unique cleaning challenge because the blade assembly at the bottom creates unreachable zones where food particles collect. The self-cleaning blending method uses the appliance's own power to solve this problem.

Ice cubes serve as mobile abrasives. When the blades spin at high speed, they shatter the ice into sharp fragments that are flung outward by centrifugal force. These fragments scrape the interior walls of the jar, dislodging dried smoothie residue, soup film, and stuck-on food that sponges cannot reach through the narrow jar opening.

Baking soda amplifies the dish soap's cleaning power by creating a mildly alkaline environment (pH 8.3) that saponifies fats -- converting grease molecules into water-soluble soap. This is particularly effective against oily residue from nut butters, avocado, and coconut milk that coat blender walls.

The lemon quarters add citric acid, which sanitizes the blade assembly and neutralizes the sulfur compounds responsible for persistent garlic and onion odors.

## Tips

- **Clean immediately.** Blending a cleaning solution right after use takes 60 seconds. Letting food dry on the jar turns a 1-minute job into a 15-minute soak and scrub.
- **For food processor bowls.** The same method works in food processors. Use the standard blade and pulse 10 times instead of blending continuously. The wider bowl shape benefits from pulsing action.
- **Stubborn garlic odor.** If garlic smell persists after one cycle, repeat with extra baking soda and lemon. Sulfur compounds from garlic bond strongly to plastic and may need two rounds.
- **Deep clean the gasket.** The rubber gasket at the base of the blender jar traps food particles. Remove it monthly, soak in a baking soda solution for 10 minutes, and scrub with a small brush.
