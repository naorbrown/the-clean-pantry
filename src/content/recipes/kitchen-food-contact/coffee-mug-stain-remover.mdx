## Steps

1. Rinse the mug with warm water to remove any liquid residue. The surface should be damp but not filled with water.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of coarse salt directly into the mug.
3. Pour 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide over the dry ingredients. The mixture will form a slightly bubbly paste. The hydrogen peroxide activates immediately as an oxidizer.
4. Using a damp sponge or cloth, scrub the interior of the mug in circular motions. Focus on the brown ring that forms at the typical fill line and the bottom of the mug where residue pools.
5. For stubborn stains, let the paste sit in the mug for 10 minutes. The extended contact time allows the hydrogen peroxide to fully oxidize the tannin deposits.
6. After scrubbing, pour 1 tablespoon of white vinegar into the mug. It will fizz as it reacts with the baking soda. Swirl the fizzing mixture around the interior to flush loosened stain particles.
7. Rinse the mug thoroughly under warm running water. Inspect for remaining stains. If the brown ring persists, repeat steps 2-6 once more.
8. Dry the mug with a clean towel. The interior should be visibly whiter and free of the characteristic brown discoloration.

## Why It Works

The brown stains in coffee and tea mugs are caused by tannins -- a class of polyphenolic compounds that bind tightly to ceramic and porcelain surfaces. Tannins polymerize over time, forming increasingly complex molecules that darken from amber to deep brown. This is why old stains are harder to remove than fresh ones.

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that breaks the conjugated double bonds in tannin polymers. These double bonds are responsible for the brown color. When oxidized, the tannin molecules fragment into smaller, colorless compounds that dissolve in water. This is the same bleaching chemistry used in tooth whitening products, which also target tannin stains.

Baking soda provides gentle physical abrasion (Mohs hardness of 2.5) that is soft enough to avoid scratching ceramic glaze (Mohs hardness of 6-7) but hard enough to scrub away the surface layer of tannin deposits. Coarse salt increases the abrasive action for heavily stained areas.

## Tips

- **Daily prevention.** Rinse your mug immediately after finishing coffee or tea. A quick rinse removes tannins before they polymerize and bond to the ceramic. Stains that are hours old take 10 times more effort to remove than fresh ones.
- **Denture tablets work too.** Drop one effervescent denture tablet into a stained mug filled with warm water. Let it fizz for 30 minutes. Denture tablets contain sodium bicarbonate and citric acid -- the same active ingredients in this recipe.
- **Inside and out.** The exterior of mugs stains too, especially around the rim where lips contact the glaze. Apply the paste to the outside rim as well.
- **Avoid abrasive pads.** Steel wool and abrasive scouring pads scratch ceramic glaze, creating microscopic grooves that make future staining worse. Always use a soft sponge with the baking soda paste.
