## Steps

1. Rinse the mug with warm water. The surface should be damp but not filled.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of coarse salt into the mug.
3. Pour 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide over the dry ingredients.
4. Scrub the interior with a damp sponge in circular motions, focusing on the fill line and bottom.
5. For stubborn stains, let the paste sit for 10 minutes.
6. Pour 1 tablespoon of white vinegar into the mug and swirl the fizzing mixture around.
7. Rinse thoroughly. If the stain persists, repeat steps 2-6.
8. Dry with a clean towel.

## Why It Works

Tannins bind tightly to ceramic surfaces and polymerize over time, darkening from amber to deep brown. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes tannin polymers, fragmenting them into colorless compounds that dissolve in water. Baking soda is soft enough to avoid scratching ceramic glaze but hard enough to scrub away surface tannin deposits. Coarse salt increases abrasion for heavy stains.

## Tips

- **Daily prevention.** Rinse your mug right after use — fresh tannins wipe off easily but bond to the glaze within hours.
- **Denture tablets work too.** Drop one into a stained mug with warm water and let it fizz for 30 minutes.
- **Inside and out.** Apply paste to the exterior rim as well, where lips contact the glaze.
- **Avoid abrasive pads.** Steel wool scratches glaze, creating grooves that worsen future staining.
