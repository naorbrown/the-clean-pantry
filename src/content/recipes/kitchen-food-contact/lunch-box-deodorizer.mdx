## Steps

1. Empty the lunch box and remove inserts, dividers, and ice packs.
2. Mix 3 tablespoons baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon dish soap, and about 1 tablespoon warm water into a thick paste.
3. Spread the paste over stained areas. Apply thicker on tough stains.
4. Let sit for 15 minutes.
5. Scrub with a soft sponge in circular motions.
6. Rinse, then drizzle 2 tablespoons vinegar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice over the interior. Let it fizz.
7. Fill with 1 cup warm water and soak 5 minutes to dissolve residue.
8. Rinse thoroughly at least twice. Air dry open and upside down.

## Why It Works

Baking soda absorbs volatile odor molecules and reacts with acidic compounds to form odorless salts. Dish soap breaks the surface tension of oily residue so the paste can reach the stain underneath. Baking soda's mild alkalinity breaks the bond between carotenoid pigments and plastic. The vinegar rinse neutralizes alkaline residue so no soapy taste transfers to food.

## Tips

- **Prevent odors overnight.** Leave the lunch box open after each use — trapped moisture causes mustiness.
- **Baking soda sachet.** Place 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a cloth sachet inside the closed box overnight.
- **Freeze stubborn odors.** Wash the box and freeze it overnight to kill odor-causing bacteria.
- **Avoid bleach.** It degrades plastic and may leave residue that contacts food.
