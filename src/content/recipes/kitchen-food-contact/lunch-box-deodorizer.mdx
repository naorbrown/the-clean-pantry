## Steps

1. Empty the lunch box and remove any removable inserts, dividers, or ice packs. Shake out crumbs and food debris.
2. Mix 3 tablespoons of baking soda with 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish soap and just enough warm water (about 1 tablespoon) to form a thick paste.
3. Spread the paste over stained areas inside the lunch box using a soft cloth or your fingers. For tough curry, tomato sauce, or berry stains, apply a thicker layer.
4. Let the paste sit for 15 minutes. The baking soda needs contact time to absorb odor-causing compounds and lift stain pigments.
5. Scrub the paste with a soft sponge using circular motions. The mild abrasion of baking soda crystals lifts stains without scratching the lunch box surface.
6. Rinse the paste away with warm water. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice over the interior surfaces. The fizzing action flushes loosened particles from seams and corners.
7. Fill the lunch box with 1 cup of warm water and let it soak for 5 minutes to dissolve any remaining baking soda residue.
8. Rinse thoroughly under running water at least twice. Leave the lunch box open and upside down to air dry completely before storing.

## Why It Works

Lunch box odors come from volatile organic compounds released by trapped food residue. Even after visible food is removed, microscopic particles lodge in seams, zipper tracks, and surface scratches. Baking soda neutralizes these odors through two mechanisms: it absorbs volatile molecules onto its porous crystal surface (adsorption), and it chemically reacts with acidic odor compounds to form odorless sodium salts.

The dish soap breaks the surface tension of oily residue from foods like cheese, dressing, and nut butters, allowing the baking soda paste to make direct contact with the stain underneath. Without soap, the paste sits on top of the grease film and cannot reach the pigment.

Tomato and curry stains are caused by carotenoid pigments that bind to plastic. Baking soda's mild alkalinity (pH 8.3) helps break the bond between these pigments and the plastic surface. The vinegar rinse neutralizes the alkaline residue and ensures the lunch box does not retain a soapy taste that could transfer to food.

## Tips

- **Prevent odors overnight.** After each use, leave the lunch box open overnight. Trapped moisture is the primary cause of musty lunch box odors.
- **Baking soda sachet.** Place 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a small cloth sachet inside the closed lunch box overnight. It absorbs ambient odors without direct contact with surfaces.
- **Freeze stubborn odors.** For persistent smells, wash the lunch box and place it in the freezer overnight. Freezing kills odor-causing bacteria and neutralizes volatile compounds.
- **Avoid bleach.** Bleach can degrade the plastic or coating in lunch boxes and may leave chemical residue that contacts food. Stick with food-safe cleaning agents.
