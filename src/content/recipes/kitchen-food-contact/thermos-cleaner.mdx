## Steps

1. Disassemble the thermos completely. Remove the lid, any drink spout, gaskets, and silicone seals. Stains and odors hide in these components.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of citric acid to the empty thermos. The dry powders should sit at the bottom.
3. Pour 2 tablespoons of white vinegar into the thermos. The triple reaction between baking soda, citric acid, and vinegar produces vigorous effervescence that reaches every interior surface.
4. Wait 30 seconds for the initial fizzing to subside, then fill the thermos with hot water (around 150 degrees F, not boiling). Add 1/2 teaspoon of dish soap.
5. Drop the lid components, gaskets, and seals into a bowl of hot water with 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Let all pieces soak for 30 minutes.
6. After 30 minutes, pour out the thermos and add 1 tablespoon of coarse salt with a splash of warm water. Swirl vigorously in a circular motion for 30 seconds. The salt scours the interior walls where coffee and tea tannins adhere.
7. Scrub the thermos interior with a bottle brush, working the brush in a twisting motion to reach the bottom corners. Scrub the lid threads and gasket grooves with a small brush.
8. Rinse all components thoroughly under running water. Air dry completely with the thermos inverted and uncapped.

## Why It Works

Insulated bottles and thermoses develop stubborn interior stains from coffee, tea, and soup. These stains are primarily tannins -- polyphenolic compounds that bond to stainless steel through metal-ligand interactions. This bond is strong enough to resist ordinary soap and water.

Citric acid and baking soda create an effervescent reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, sodium citrate, and water. The mechanical action of the gas bubbles reaches surfaces that a brush cannot, including the narrow neck and curved bottom of most thermoses. Sodium citrate is a chelating agent that pulls metal ions away from tannin-metal bonds, weakening the stain's grip on the steel.

White vinegar adds acetic acid to the mix, providing a second organic acid that attacks tannin deposits from a different chemical angle. The combination of citric and acetic acids dissolves a broader range of stain compounds than either acid alone. Coarse salt provides the physical abrasion needed to scrub away any remaining stain particles that the chemical soak has loosened.

## Tips

- **Coffee stain prevention.** Rinse the thermos with hot water immediately after emptying your coffee. Tannins bond more aggressively to steel as the liquid cools and concentrates.
- **Remove metallic taste.** If your thermos has a metallic taste after cleaning, fill it with a solution of 1 tablespoon of baking soda in warm water and let it sit overnight. Rinse thoroughly.
- **Do not use bleach.** Bleach can pit stainless steel and degrade the rubber gaskets that maintain the vacuum seal.
- **Clean weekly for daily users.** If you use a thermos every day for coffee or tea, a weekly deep clean prevents the tannin buildup that becomes increasingly difficult to remove over time.
