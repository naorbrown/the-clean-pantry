## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a heat-safe glass bowl or small pot over a pot of simmering water. The bowl should not touch the water.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of grated beeswax to the bowl. Stir occasionally until completely melted, about 3-4 minutes.
3. Add 3 tablespoons of food-grade mineral oil and 1 tablespoon of refined coconut oil to the melted beeswax. Stir until fully combined and liquid.
4. Remove from heat and add 1/2 teaspoon of vitamin E oil if using. Stir to incorporate. The vitamin E acts as an antioxidant that prevents the oils from going rancid.
5. Pour the warm mixture into a small tin or jar. Let it cool at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. It will solidify into a soft, buttery paste.
6. To apply, scoop a small amount onto a clean soft cloth and rub it into the wood surface using circular motions, working with the grain. Apply generously to dry or rough patches.
7. Let the conditioner absorb for 15-20 minutes. Wipe off any excess with a clean dry cloth. The wood should feel smooth and slightly satiny, not greasy.
8. Repeat monthly for cutting boards and every 2-3 months for wooden spoons, spatulas, and other utensils that see regular use.

## Why It Works

Wood is a hygroscopic material, meaning it absorbs and releases moisture from its environment. In a kitchen, this cycle of wetting during use and drying between uses causes wood fibers to swell and shrink repeatedly. Over time, this leads to cracking, splitting, and a rough surface texture that harbors bacteria.

Food-grade mineral oil penetrates deep into the wood grain, displacing water and filling the spaces between wood fibers. Unlike vegetable oils (olive, canola, etc.), mineral oil does not oxidize or go rancid because it is a saturated hydrocarbon with no double bonds for oxygen to attack. This makes it the only oil category that is both food-safe and shelf-stable in wood.

Beeswax creates a protective surface barrier that mineral oil alone cannot provide. While the oil soaks in, the wax remains on the surface as a hydrophobic seal that repels water, prevents staining, and reduces the absorption of food odors. Coconut oil adds additional moisture resistance and gives the finished conditioner a smoother, easier-to-apply texture.

## Tips

- **The water test.** To check if your board or utensil needs conditioning, sprinkle a few drops of water on the surface. If the water soaks in rather than beading up, it is time to re-apply.
- **Warm the wood first.** Before applying conditioner, warm the board or utensil briefly in a low oven (150 degrees F for 5 minutes) or in direct sunlight. Warm wood absorbs oil more deeply and evenly.
- **New board treatment.** Brand new cutting boards benefit from three applications in the first week -- one per day for three days. This saturates the fresh wood and establishes a strong protective foundation.
- **Never use cooking oils.** Olive oil, vegetable oil, and other cooking fats will go rancid in wood, producing off smells and potentially harboring harmful bacteria. Always use food-grade mineral oil as the base.
