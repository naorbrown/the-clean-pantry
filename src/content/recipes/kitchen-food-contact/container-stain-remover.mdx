## Steps

1. Wash the container with dish soap and warm water to remove any food residue. The surface must be clean so the stain treatment can work directly on the pigment.
2. Make a paste by combining 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of dish soap. Stir until smooth as the mixture fizzes.
3. Spread the paste over all stained areas inside the container using a soft cloth or your fingers. Apply a thick layer over the worst stains.
4. Place the open container in direct sunlight near a window or outdoors. Sunlight dramatically accelerates stain breakdown through UV-activated photodegradation of carotenoid pigments.
5. Let the container sit in sunlight for 2-3 hours. If sunlight is unavailable, the paste alone will work but requires overnight contact time.
6. After the sunlight treatment, add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the container and scrub with a soft sponge. The vinegar reacts with remaining baking soda to produce a fresh round of fizzing that lifts loosened pigment.
7. Rinse thoroughly under running water. If staining persists, repeat steps 2-6 one more time.
8. After the container is clean and dry, rub 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil over the interior surface with a paper towel. This fills microscopic pores in the plastic and makes future stains easier to remove.

## Why It Works

Tomato sauce and curry stain plastic through a specific mechanism: the carotenoid pigments (lycopene in tomatoes, curcumin in turmeric) are fat-soluble molecules that migrate into the porous surface of polypropylene and polyethylene plastics. Because they dissolve into the plastic rather than sitting on the surface, water-based cleaners cannot reach them.

Baking soda paste works through adsorption -- the porous baking soda crystals physically attract and pull pigment molecules out of the plastic surface. Lemon juice provides citric acid, which breaks down the molecular structure of carotenoids, converting them from brightly colored compounds into colorless byproducts.

Sunlight is the key accelerator. UV radiation (specifically UV-A at 315-400 nanometers) causes photodegradation of carotenoid pigments. These molecules absorb UV energy, which breaks the conjugated double bonds responsible for their color. This is the same process that causes sun-bleaching of colored fabrics, harnessed here intentionally for stain removal.

## Tips

- **Prevent stains proactively.** Spray the inside of plastic containers with cooking spray before storing tomato-based foods. The oil barrier prevents carotenoids from contacting the plastic.
- **Glass for repeat offenders.** If you regularly store curry or tomato sauce, switch to glass containers for those specific foods. Glass is non-porous and does not stain.
- **Do not microwave tomato sauce in plastic.** Heat opens the polymer structure of plastic, allowing pigments to penetrate deeper. Always transfer to glass or ceramic before microwaving.
- **White containers show stains most.** Clear or white polypropylene is most visibly affected. If you cook with turmeric frequently, darker containers hide staining better.
