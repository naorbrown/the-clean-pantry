## Steps

1. Wash the container with dish soap and warm water to remove food residue.
2. Make a paste from 2 tablespoons baking soda, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon dish soap.
3. Spread the paste over all stained areas. Apply a thick layer on the worst spots.
4. Place the open container in direct sunlight for 2-3 hours. Without sunlight, leave the paste on overnight.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and scrub with a soft sponge.
6. Rinse thoroughly. If staining persists, repeat steps 2-5.
7. Once clean and dry, rub 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil over the interior to prevent future stains.

## Why It Works

Carotenoid pigments (lycopene in tomatoes, curcumin in turmeric) are fat-soluble and migrate into porous plastic, so water-based cleaners cannot reach them. Baking soda crystals physically pull pigment molecules out of the surface. Lemon juice breaks down carotenoids into colorless byproducts. UV sunlight accelerates the process by degrading the pigment molecules directly.

## Tips

- **Prevent stains proactively.** Spray containers with cooking spray before storing tomato-based foods.
- **Glass for repeat offenders.** Glass is non-porous and does not stain.
- **Do not microwave tomato sauce in plastic.** Heat opens the polymer structure, letting pigments penetrate deeper.
- **White containers show stains most.** Darker containers hide staining better if you cook with turmeric frequently.
