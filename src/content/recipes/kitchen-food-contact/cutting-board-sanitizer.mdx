## Steps

1. Rinse the cutting board under warm running water to remove loose food particles. Pat the surface with a clean towel but leave it slightly damp.
2. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of coarse salt evenly across the entire board surface. The salt acts as a gentle abrasive and draws moisture from any bacteria on the surface.
3. Cut a lemon in half and use the cut side as a scrubber. Press the lemon firmly into the salt and scrub the entire board using circular motions. Squeeze gently as you scrub to release juice into the salt.
4. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of baking soda over the lemon-salt mixture. Continue scrubbing for another minute. The baking soda fizzes slightly as it reacts with the citric acid, helping to lift stains from the wood grain.
5. Let the mixture sit on the board for 5 minutes. This contact time allows the citric acid and salt to penetrate the wood pores where bacteria hide.
6. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of white vinegar over the board surface. The vinegar reacts with the baking soda residue and provides additional antimicrobial action.
7. Rinse the board under warm running water, using your hand to wipe away all salt and lemon residue. Do not soak or submerge the board.
8. Stand the board upright on its edge to air dry. Drying on a flat surface traps moisture underneath, which promotes warping and mildew.

## Why It Works

Wooden cutting boards are porous, meaning bacteria can migrate below the surface where a simple rinse cannot reach them. Coarse salt draws moisture out of the wood through osmosis, dehydrating surface bacteria. As you scrub with the lemon half, citric acid (pH 2.2) penetrates the wood grain and creates an environment too acidic for most foodborne bacteria, including E. coli and salmonella, to survive.

The baking soda serves a dual purpose: it reacts with citric acid to produce carbon dioxide bubbles that physically push debris out of knife cuts and scratches, and it neutralizes odor-causing compounds trapped in the wood. Onion and garlic odors are caused by sulfur compounds that baking soda converts into odorless sodium salts.

White vinegar adds a second acid (acetic acid) with a different molecular structure than citric acid, broadening the antimicrobial spectrum. Studies show that sequential application of different organic acids is more effective than using either acid alone.

## Tips

- **Deep stain removal.** For stubborn stains from beets, berries, or turmeric, make a paste of baking soda and lemon juice and let it sit on the stain for 15 minutes before scrubbing.
- **Monthly maintenance.** After sanitizing, condition the board by rubbing it with food-grade mineral oil. This fills the wood pores and creates a barrier that resists future staining and bacterial penetration.
- **Separate boards for safety.** Even with thorough sanitizing, use separate cutting boards for raw meat and produce. No cleaning method eliminates 100% of bacteria from wood.
- **Avoid the dishwasher.** The extreme heat and prolonged water exposure in a dishwasher will crack and warp wooden boards within a few cycles.
