## Steps

1. Rinse the cutting board under warm water and pat slightly damp.
2. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of coarse salt evenly across the board.
3. Cut a lemon in half and scrub the board with the cut side, pressing firmly into the salt. Squeeze gently to release juice.
4. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of baking soda and scrub for another minute.
5. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.
6. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of white vinegar over the surface.
7. Rinse under warm water. Do not soak or submerge the board.
8. Stand the board upright on its edge to air dry.

## Why It Works

Coarse salt dehydrates surface bacteria through osmosis. Citric acid from the lemon penetrates the wood grain, creating an environment too acidic for most foodborne bacteria. Baking soda reacts with citric acid to push debris out of knife cuts, and neutralizes odor-causing sulfur compounds. White vinegar adds a second acid that broadens the antimicrobial spectrum.

## Tips

- **Deep stain removal.** For beets, berries, or turmeric, let a baking soda and lemon juice paste sit for 15 minutes before scrubbing.
- **Monthly maintenance.** Condition the board with food-grade mineral oil to resist future staining.
- **Separate boards for safety.** Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and produce.
- **Avoid the dishwasher.** Heat and water exposure will crack and warp wooden boards.
