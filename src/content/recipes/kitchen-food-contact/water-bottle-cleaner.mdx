## Steps

1. Disassemble the bottle completely. Remove the cap, straw, gaskets, and any silicone seals. These small parts harbor bacteria and biofilm in crevices.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of coarse salt directly into the bottle.
3. Pour 1/4 cup of white vinegar into the bottle. The mixture will fizz vigorously. Let it fizz for 30 seconds before adding water -- the initial reaction is the most effective at loosening deposits.
4. Fill the rest of the bottle with hot water (not boiling, which can warp plastic). Swirl to distribute the solution throughout.
5. Drop the cap, straw, and gaskets into a small bowl. Cover them with a mixture of 1 tablespoon each of baking soda and vinegar topped with hot water. Let all pieces soak for 20 minutes.
6. After soaking, scrub the inside of the bottle with a bottle brush. Pay special attention to the bottom corners and the threads at the top where the cap screws on.
7. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to the bottle, swirl, and let sit for 5 more minutes. The citric acid provides a final sanitizing rinse and leaves a clean scent.
8. Rinse all pieces thoroughly under running water at least three times. Reassemble and allow the bottle to air dry upside down with the cap off.

## Why It Works

Reusable water bottles develop biofilm -- a slimy colony of bacteria embedded in a self-produced matrix of proteins and sugars. Biofilm adheres strongly to surfaces and resists simple rinsing. Studies have found that water bottles used daily without deep cleaning harbor more bacteria per square centimeter than the average kitchen sink.

Baking soda is a mild alkali that disrupts the protein matrix holding biofilm together. When combined with vinegar, the carbon dioxide gas produced by the acid-base reaction physically lifts the loosened biofilm from the bottle walls. Coarse salt adds mechanical abrasion during the swirling step, scraping biofilm from textured surfaces and seams.

Lemon juice provides citric acid for the final rinse, which lowers the surface pH and creates a briefly inhospitable environment for bacterial regrowth. This buys time between cleanings by slowing the rate at which new biofilm forms.

## Tips

- **Clean weekly.** Even if the bottle only holds water, biofilm begins forming within 24 hours of use. A weekly deep clean prevents the slimy buildup that causes musty odors.
- **Do not forget the cap.** Screw-on caps have threads that trap moisture and bacteria. Use a small brush or pipe cleaner to scrub between the threads.
- **Dry completely.** Bacteria need moisture to thrive. After cleaning, leave the bottle uncapped and inverted on a drying rack until completely dry.
- **Ice cubes for scrubbing.** If you do not have a bottle brush, add a handful of ice cubes with the salt and baking soda, then shake vigorously. The ice provides the abrasion needed to loosen biofilm.
