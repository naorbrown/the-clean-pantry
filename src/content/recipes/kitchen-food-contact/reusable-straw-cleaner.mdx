## Steps

1. Rinse each straw under warm running water immediately after use. Push water through the straw by holding one end under the faucet and letting pressure force water through. This removes the bulk of residue before it dries.
2. Fill a tall glass or container with 2 cups of hot water. The container should be tall enough to fully submerge the straws vertically.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish soap to the hot water. Stir to dissolve.
4. Place the straws in the solution and pour 2 tablespoons of white vinegar directly into the glass. The fizzing reaction pushes cleaning solution through the narrow straw interiors.
5. Let the straws soak for 15 minutes. For smoothie or thick beverage residue, extend the soak to 20 minutes.
6. Remove each straw from the soak and push a straw cleaning brush through the entire length. Twist the brush as you push and pull to scrub the interior walls. Repeat 3-4 passes per straw.
7. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to a cup of clean water. Submerge the brushed straws for a 2-minute citric acid rinse that sanitizes and deodorizes.
8. Rinse each straw thoroughly under running water, pushing fresh water through the interior. Stand straws upright in a cup or drying rack to air dry completely. Moisture trapped inside straws is the primary cause of mold growth.

## Why It Works

Reusable straws have an extremely high surface-area-to-volume ratio inside their narrow tubes, creating ideal conditions for biofilm formation. Sugary drinks, smoothie residue, and milk proteins adhere to the interior walls and provide nutrients for bacterial growth. Studies have found that straws cleaned only by rinsing can harbor significant bacterial colonies within 48 hours.

The baking soda soak creates an alkaline environment (pH 8.3) that disrupts the protein matrix of biofilm. When vinegar is added, the carbon dioxide gas produced by the acid-base reaction creates turbulence inside the narrow straw tube, mechanically loosening deposits that a soak alone cannot reach. The gas expansion forces the cleaning solution into contact with the entire interior surface.

The straw brush provides essential mechanical scrubbing that no chemical soak can replace. The narrow bristles physically break up biofilm and dislodge dried residue from the straw walls. The final lemon juice rinse lowers the pH of the straw surface, creating a briefly acidic environment that inhibits immediate bacterial recolonization.

## Tips

- **One brush per straw type.** Metal, glass, and silicone straws have different interior textures. Using a dedicated brush for each prevents cross-contamination of materials.
- **Silicone straws need extra attention.** Silicone is softer and more porous than metal or glass, making it more prone to staining and odor retention. Soak silicone straws for the full 20 minutes.
- **Bent straws are hardest to clean.** If your straws have a bend or elbow, flex the brush through the curve slowly. Food residue concentrates at the bend where liquid flow slows.
- **Dishwasher basket for convenience.** Place straws in a mesh dishwasher basket for regular cycle cleaning, but still do a manual deep clean with this method every 1-2 weeks. The dishwasher alone does not adequately clean straw interiors.
