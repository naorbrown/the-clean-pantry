## Steps

1. Combine distilled water and white vinegar in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add castile soap and olive oil. Cap and shake for 10 seconds.
3. Add lemon essential oil if desired. Shake again.
4. Shake gently before each use since the oil separates.
5. Spray lightly onto a microfiber cloth, not directly onto the dashboard.
6. Wipe the dashboard, console, door panels, and steering wheel, turning the cloth frequently.
7. For vents and crevices, wrap the cloth around a butter knife or use a dampened cotton swab.
8. Buff dry with a second microfiber cloth for a matte, streak-free finish.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves the film of dust, skin oils, and off-gassed residue that builds up on dashboards without damaging UV stabilizers. Castile soap emulsifies the oily layer for clean removal. Olive oil replaces plasticizers that leach from vinyl during sun exposure, keeping it supple and crack-resistant. Unlike silicone-based sprays, olive oil absorbs into vinyl instead of sitting on top as a dust-attracting film.

## Tips

- Never use ammonia-based cleaners on dashboards. Ammonia degrades vinyl and causes cracking.
- Clean on a cool day or in shade. Hot surfaces evaporate the cleaner before you can wipe it.
- Use monthly to prevent dust buildup and keep plastics conditioned.
- For leather-wrapped steering wheels, use sparingly -- too much oil makes the surface slippery.
