## Steps

1. Combine the distilled water and white vinegar in a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the castile soap and olive oil. Cap and shake gently for 10 seconds.
3. Add the lemon essential oil if desired. Shake again to combine.
4. To use, shake the bottle gently before each use since the oil will separate.
5. Spray lightly onto a clean microfiber cloth, not directly onto the dashboard.
6. Wipe the dashboard, console, door panels, and steering wheel in smooth strokes, turning the cloth frequently to expose clean surfaces.
7. For vents and crevices, wrap the cloth around a butter knife or use a cotton swab dampened with the solution.
8. Buff dry with a second clean microfiber cloth for a matte, streak-free finish.

## Why It Works

Dashboard surfaces accumulate a film of dust, skin oils, UV protectant residue, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that off-gas from the vinyl and plastic over time. White vinegar's acetic acid dissolves this film without damaging the UV stabilizers built into modern dashboard materials. Castile soap acts as a surfactant that emulsifies the oily layer so it can be wiped away cleanly. The small amount of olive oil replaces the plasticizers that leach out of vinyl over years of sun exposure, keeping the material supple and preventing the cracking and fading that comes from dried-out plastic. Unlike silicone-based commercial dashboard sprays, olive oil absorbs into the vinyl rather than sitting on top as a dust-attracting film. Distilled water prevents mineral spots that tap water can leave on dark surfaces.

## Tips

- Never use ammonia-based cleaners (like Windex) on dashboards. Ammonia degrades vinyl and can cause cracking over time.
- Clean the dashboard on a cool day or when the car is parked in shade. Hot surfaces cause the cleaner to evaporate before you can wipe it.
- Use this cleaner monthly to prevent dust buildup and keep plastics conditioned.
- For leather-wrapped steering wheels, use the spray sparingly -- too much oil can make the surface slippery.
- Shake the bottle before every use. The oil and water will always separate between uses, which is normal.
