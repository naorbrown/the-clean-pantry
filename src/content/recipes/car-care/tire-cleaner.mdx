## Steps

1. In a large bowl, dissolve the baking soda in warm water, stirring until no granules remain.
2. Add the white vinegar slowly, allowing the fizzing to subside.
3. Stir in the castile soap and lemon juice. Pour the mixture into a 32 oz spray bottle.
4. Rinse the wheels and tires with plain water from a hose to remove loose mud and grit.
5. Spray the cleaning solution generously onto one wheel and tire at a time, coating the entire surface including spokes, lug nut recesses, and the tire sidewall.
6. Let the solution sit for 3 to 5 minutes to break down brake dust and road grime.
7. Scrub the wheel with a soft wheel brush and the tire sidewall with a stiff-bristle brush. Use an old toothbrush or detail brush for lug nut areas and tight spoke gaps.
8. Rinse thoroughly with a strong hose stream and move to the next wheel. Repeat for all four.

## Why It Works

Brake dust is composed primarily of iron particles shed from brake rotors combined with carbon fibers and adhesive resins from brake pads. This metallic dust bonds electrostatically to wheel surfaces and bakes on from the heat of braking. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves the iron oxide (rust) component of brake dust, breaking its bond with the wheel surface. Lemon juice adds citric acid, which chelates iron ions -- meaning it wraps around the iron atoms and pulls them into solution. Baking soda provides gentle mechanical abrasion for scrubbing and helps neutralize the acidic road grime that etches into clear-coated wheels. Castile soap emulsifies the oily components of brake dust (the resin binders) and road tar, allowing them to be rinsed away. Together, these agents address every component of wheel contamination through complementary chemical mechanisms.

## Tips

- Clean wheels before washing the car body. This prevents dirty wheel rinse water from splashing onto clean paint.
- For baked-on brake dust on neglected wheels, soak a microfiber cloth in straight vinegar, wrap it around the affected area, and let it sit for 10 minutes before scrubbing.
- Never clean hot wheels after a drive. Let them cool for at least 30 minutes. Hot metal causes the cleaning solution to evaporate instantly and can cause thermal shock on some finishes.
- Apply a wheel sealant or wax after cleaning to make future brake dust removal easier.
- This formula is safe for most painted and clear-coated factory wheels. Test on a hidden area first for aftermarket or specialty finishes.
