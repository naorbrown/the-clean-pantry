## Steps

1. Pour 12 cups of distilled water into a clean 1-gallon jug.
2. Add 4 cups of isopropyl alcohol. The 3:1 water-to-alcohol ratio provides freeze protection down to approximately 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Add the white vinegar and castile soap.
4. Cap the jug tightly and invert it several times to mix. Do not shake vigorously -- you want to avoid excess foam.
5. Pour the fluid into your vehicle's windshield washer reservoir using a funnel.
6. Test the sprayers to ensure proper coverage across the windshield.
7. Store any remaining fluid in its labeled jug at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.

## Why It Works

Commercial washer fluids rely on methanol as an antifreeze agent, which is highly toxic and produces harmful fumes when sprayed on a warm windshield. Isopropyl alcohol serves the same antifreeze function but with significantly lower toxicity. It depresses the freezing point of water through colligative properties -- the alcohol molecules disrupt the hydrogen bonding network that water needs to form ice crystals. At a 3:1 ratio, this gives protection to about 20 degrees F, suitable for most three-season driving. White vinegar dissolves the calcium and magnesium deposits from road spray that create hazy films on windshields. Castile soap provides just enough surfactant action to break up bug splatter and road film, but in low enough concentration to avoid leaving streaks or interfering with wiper blade contact.

## Tips

- For extreme cold below 0 degrees F, increase to 91% isopropyl alcohol and use a 1:1 ratio of water to alcohol.
- Always use distilled water. Tap water contains minerals that clog washer nozzles over time and leave white spots on glass.
- Do not add dish soap as a substitute for castile soap. Dish soap foams excessively and can clog the pump.
- Label the storage jug clearly. The mixture looks like water but contains alcohol.
- This fluid is safe for factory-installed washer pumps and hoses. The alcohol concentration is well within the range that rubber seals are designed to handle.
