## Steps

1. Clean the headlight lens with soap and water to remove surface dirt. Dry completely.
2. Apply painter's tape around the perimeter of each headlight to protect the surrounding paint.
3. In a small bowl, mix the baking soda with the vinegar and water to form a thick paste. Add castile soap and stir until smooth.
4. Apply the paste to the headlight lens with a damp microfiber cloth, using firm circular motions. Work the paste over the entire surface for 2 to 3 minutes per headlight.
5. For heavily yellowed lenses, reapply fresh paste and repeat the circular scrubbing for another 2 minutes.
6. Rinse the lens with clean water and dry with a microfiber towel. The lens should appear noticeably clearer.
7. Apply a thin layer of coconut oil to the clean lens with a soft cloth, buffing in a circular motion. This fills micro-scratches and adds temporary UV protection.
8. For longer-lasting results, apply a thin coat of automotive paste wax over the headlight and buff to a shine after 5 minutes.

## Why It Works

Headlight lenses are made of polycarbonate plastic with a factory-applied UV-resistant clear coat. Over years of sun exposure, the clear coat degrades and the underlying polycarbonate oxidizes, forming a porous yellow layer on the surface. Baking soda particles have a Mohs hardness of about 2.5, which is soft enough to avoid scratching polycarbonate (Mohs 3.5) but abrasive enough to mechanically remove the oxidized surface layer through gentle polishing. The vinegar reacts with the baking soda to create sodium acetate, which acts as a mild chemical stripper for oxidized material. Coconut oil fills the micro-scratches left by polishing, which is why the lens looks dramatically clearer immediately after application. The oil also contains lauric acid, which provides temporary UV screening. The wax sealant step is critical for longevity because it creates a sacrificial barrier between the polycarbonate and UV radiation, mimicking the factory clear coat.

## Tips

- This treatment lasts 2 to 4 months without the wax step, and 6 to 12 months with it. Plan to reapply seasonally.
- For the most durable results, apply a spray-on UV clear coat (available at auto parts stores) instead of wax. This can last 1 to 2 years.
- Work in the shade. Direct sun heats the plastic and makes the paste dry too quickly to be effective.
- Do not use this on glass headlight lenses found on some vintage vehicles. Glass requires different abrasives.
- If the yellowing is on the inside of the lens, no external treatment will help. That requires removing and cleaning the lens housing.
