## Steps

1. Clean the headlight lens with soap and water. Dry completely.
2. Apply painter's tape around each headlight to protect surrounding paint.
3. Mix baking soda with vinegar and water to form a thick paste. Add castile soap and stir smooth.
4. Apply the paste with a damp microfiber cloth using firm circular motions, 2 to 3 minutes per headlight.
5. For heavily yellowed lenses, reapply fresh paste and scrub another 2 minutes.
6. Rinse with clean water and dry with a microfiber towel.
7. Apply a thin layer of coconut oil with a soft cloth, buffing in circular motions.
8. For longer-lasting results, apply automotive paste wax over the headlight and buff after 5 minutes.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (Mohs hardness 2.5) is soft enough to avoid scratching polycarbonate (Mohs 3.5) but abrasive enough to remove the oxidized yellow layer. Vinegar acts as a mild chemical stripper for oxidized material. Coconut oil fills micro-scratches left by polishing, making the lens look dramatically clearer. Wax creates a sacrificial UV barrier that mimics the factory clear coat.

## Tips

- Lasts 2 to 4 months without wax, 6 to 12 months with it. Reapply seasonally.
- For the most durable results, apply a spray-on UV clear coat instead of wax.
- Work in the shade. Sun heats the plastic and dries the paste too fast.
- Do not use on glass headlight lenses found on some vintage vehicles.
- If yellowing is on the inside of the lens, no external treatment will help.
