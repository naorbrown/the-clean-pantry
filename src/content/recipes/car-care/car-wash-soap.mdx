## Steps

1. Fill a large bucket with 2 gallons of warm water.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap and stir gently to create suds without excessive agitation.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and 1 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. Stir to combine.
4. Rinse the entire car with plain water from a hose to remove loose dirt and grit.
5. Dip a wash mitt or large sponge into the soapy water and wash one panel at a time, starting from the roof and working down.
6. Rinse each panel with clean water before moving to the next to prevent the soap from drying on the paint.
7. After washing all panels, give the entire car a final rinse with clean water.
8. Dry immediately with a clean microfiber drying towel to prevent water spots.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is derived from plant oils (typically olive, coconut, or hemp) and has a naturally neutral to mildly alkaline pH of around 8 to 9. This is gentle enough to clean road grime, bug splatter, and light dirt without stripping the wax or sealant layer that protects your paint. Conventional dish soaps, by comparison, have a pH of 9 to 11 and contain degreasers specifically designed to strip oils -- which is exactly what your wax coating is. Vegetable glycerin provides lubrication between the wash mitt and the paint surface, reducing the micro-scratching that causes swirl marks over time. The small amount of vinegar counteracts the alkalinity of hard tap water, helping prevent mineral deposits from forming as the car dries.

## Tips

- Never use dish soap (Dawn, Ajax, etc.) to wash your car. These products strip wax and can degrade clear coat with repeated use.
- Use the two-bucket method: one bucket with soapy water and one with plain rinse water. Rinse your mitt in the clean water before dipping it back into the soap bucket. This keeps grit out of your wash solution.
- Wash the wheels and tires last with a separate mitt or brush. Brake dust is abrasive and will contaminate your paint wash mitt.
- In direct sunlight, the car surface can reach 140 degrees F or higher. At that temperature, water evaporates before you can rinse it, leaving mineral spots and soap residue.

## Alternative

- For extra cleaning power on heavily soiled vehicles, increase the castile soap to 3 tablespoons and add 1 tablespoon of baking soda dissolved in the warm water. The baking soda provides mild abrasive action that helps with bug residue and tree sap.
- For a waterless wash option in drought conditions, mix 1 tablespoon of castile soap with 2 cups of distilled water in a spray bottle. Spray one panel at a time, let it sit for 30 seconds, and wipe with a microfiber towel. Only suitable for lightly dusty cars -- not for cars with mud or heavy grit.
