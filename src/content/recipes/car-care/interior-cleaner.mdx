## Steps

1. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar to a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Pour in 1 1/2 cups of distilled water.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap.
4. Add 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and shake well.
5. Spray a light mist onto a microfiber cloth -- not directly onto the surface.
6. Wipe down the dashboard, center console, door panels, and steering wheel.
7. Flip the cloth to a dry side and buff to remove residue.

## Why It Works

Castile soap lifts dust, fingerprints, and sticky residue without petroleum-based residues. Vinegar cuts through the haze from off-gassing plasticizers on plastic and vinyl. Olive oil absorbs into vinyl to keep it supple and UV-resistant without creating a slippery, shiny finish.

## Alternative

- Replace olive oil with 1/2 teaspoon of jojoba oil for a lighter finish on matte dashboards.
- Add 5 drops of lemon essential oil for citrus scent and extra grease-cutting.

## Tips

- For the inside of the windshield, use only vinegar and water (skip soap and oil) to avoid streaking.
- Do not use on leather seats. Leather needs a pH-neutral cleaner and separate conditioner.
- Shake before each use -- oil separates from water between uses.
- Keeps for up to 3 months at room temperature.
