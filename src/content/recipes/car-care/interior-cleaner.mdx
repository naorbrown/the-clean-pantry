## Steps

1. Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar to a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Pour in 1 1/2 cups of distilled water.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap.
4. Add 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and shake well to combine.
5. Spray a light mist onto a microfiber cloth -- not directly onto the surface.
6. Wipe down the dashboard, center console, door panels, and steering wheel.
7. Flip the cloth to a dry side and buff the surface to remove any residue and bring out a subtle sheen.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant that lifts dust, fingerprints, and sticky residue from hard interior surfaces without leaving behind the petroleum-based residues found in commercial interior cleaners. The small amount of vinegar cuts through film buildup on plastic and vinyl, particularly the haze that forms on the inside of windshields from off-gassing plasticizers. Olive oil replaces the silicone-based conditioners in conventional products -- it absorbs into vinyl and plastic to keep them supple and resistant to UV cracking, without creating a slippery, artificially shiny finish.

## Tips

- Use distilled water to prevent mineral spots on dark dashboards and glossy trim pieces.
- For the inside of the windshield, use only the vinegar and water (skip the soap and oil) to avoid streaking in direct sunlight.
- Do not use this cleaner on leather seats. Leather requires a pH-neutral cleaner and a separate conditioning step to avoid drying out the hide.
- Shake the bottle before each use since the oil will separate from the water over time.
- This solution keeps for up to 3 months at room temperature. Discard if it develops an off smell.

## Alternative

- Replace the olive oil with 1/2 teaspoon of jojoba oil for a lighter finish that absorbs faster and leaves less residue on matte-finish dashboards.
- Add 5 drops of lemon essential oil for a fresh citrus scent and additional grease-cutting power.
