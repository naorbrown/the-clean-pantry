## Steps

1. **Pre-treat stains:** Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of baking soda on visible stains. Let sit 10 minutes, then brush off.
2. Pour 1 cup of fresh club soda into a 16 oz spray bottle.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. Wait for fizzing to subside.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap. Shake gently.
5. Spray a light mist onto the dirty area -- do not soak the fabric.
6. Work the solution in with a soft-bristled brush using circular motions.
7. Blot with a dry microfiber cloth to lift dissolved dirt. Do not rub.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 on stubborn spots until the cloth comes away clean.
9. Leave doors or windows open for 30 minutes to air dry.

## Why It Works

Club soda's carbonation dislodges dirt trapped below the fabric surface. Castile soap emulsifies oily residues (body oils, sunscreen, food grease) for blotting. Vinegar neutralizes alkaline stains and kills odor-causing bacteria. The baking soda pre-treatment absorbs fresh oils before wet cleaning, preventing the stain from spreading.

## Alternative

- For heavily stained seats, add 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide (3%). Test in a hidden area first, as it may lighten dark fabrics.
- Substitute sparkling mineral water for club soda.

## Tips

- Blot from the outside edge of a stain toward the center to avoid spreading.
- Use within a few hours of mixing. Flat club soda is much less effective.
- Safe for child car seat stains -- no synthetic fragrances or harsh chemicals.
- Do not use on leather, suede, or Alcantara.
- For musty smell after cleaning, sprinkle dry baking soda on damp upholstery, let it dry fully, then vacuum.
