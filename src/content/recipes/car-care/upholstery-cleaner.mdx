## Steps

1. **Pre-treat stains:** Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of baking soda directly on any visible stains. Let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb oils and loosen grime, then brush it off with a soft-bristled brush.
2. Pour 1 cup of fresh club soda into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. Wait for the initial fizzing to subside before adding the soap.
4. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap.
5. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake gently.
6. Spray a light mist onto the stained or dirty area of the upholstery -- do not soak the fabric.
7. Work the solution into the fabric with a soft-bristled brush using circular motions.
8. Blot with a clean, dry microfiber cloth to lift the dissolved dirt out of the fibers. Do not rub -- rubbing pushes dirt deeper and can damage fabric texture.
9. Repeat steps 6 through 8 on stubborn spots until the cloth comes away clean.
10. Leave the car doors or windows open for 30 minutes to allow the fabric to air dry completely.

## Why It Works

Club soda's carbonation physically agitates dirt particles trapped in fabric fibers -- the bubbles push into the weave and dislodge grime from below the surface. The dissolved sodium bicarbonate in club soda provides mild alkalinity that breaks down organic stains like coffee, juice, and food. Castile soap acts as a surfactant to emulsify oily residues (body oils from skin, sunscreen, fast food grease) so they can be blotted away with a cloth. The vinegar provides acidity that neutralizes alkaline stains and deodorizes the fabric by killing odor-causing bacteria. The baking soda pre-treatment absorbs fresh oils before the wet cleaning step, preventing the stain from spreading when liquid is applied.

## Tips

- Always blot from the outside edge of a stain toward the center. Working outward spreads the stain into clean fabric.
- Use this cleaner within a few hours of mixing. Club soda loses its carbonation quickly, and flat club soda is significantly less effective.
- For child car seat stains (juice boxes, snack crumbs, diaper accidents), this formula is safe because it contains no synthetic fragrances or harsh chemicals.
- Do not use on leather, suede, or Alcantara. These materials require specialized pH-neutral cleaners designed for protein-based fibers and treated hides.
- If the car smells musty after cleaning, sprinkle dry baking soda on the damp upholstery, let it sit until the fabric is completely dry, then vacuum it up.

## Alternative

- For a deeper-cleaning version that works on heavily stained seats, add 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide (3%) to the mix. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxygen-based bleach that breaks down organic stains without chlorine. Test in a hidden area first, as it may lighten some dark fabrics.
- Substitute sparkling mineral water for club soda -- it contains similar carbonation and mineral content.
