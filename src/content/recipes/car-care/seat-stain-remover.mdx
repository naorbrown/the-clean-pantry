## Steps

1. Vacuum the seat to remove loose dirt and crumbs.
2. For grease stains, sprinkle cornstarch on the stain. Let sit 10 minutes, then vacuum off.
3. Dissolve baking soda in warm water in a spray bottle, shaking until no granules remain.
4. Add vinegar slowly, let fizzing subside, then add castile soap and hydrogen peroxide. Shake gently.
5. Spray the stain until damp but not soaking. Let sit 5 minutes.
6. Scrub with a soft-bristle brush from the outside of the stain toward the center.
7. Blot with a microfiber towel, pressing firmly. Repeat spraying and blotting if needed.
8. Leave windows open or run ventilation to dry seats within an hour.

## Why It Works

Vinegar breaks down tannin-based stains (coffee, tea, juice) that bond to fabric fibers. Baking soda emulsifies food oils and protein stains. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the colored compounds in stains, making them colorless. Castile soap reduces surface tension so cleaning agents penetrate tight automotive weave. Cornstarch pre-treatment pulls grease out of fabric into the starch granules.

## Tips

- Always blot stains, never rub. Rubbing pushes the stain deeper.
- Treat stains as quickly as possible. Fresh stains respond far better than set-in ones.
- For stubborn old stains, cover the sprayed area with a damp cloth for 30 minutes before scrubbing.
- Keep a small bottle of this solution in the trunk for spill emergencies.
- Do not use on leather or vinyl seats.
