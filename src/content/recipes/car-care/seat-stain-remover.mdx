## Steps

1. Vacuum the seat thoroughly to remove loose dirt and crumbs before applying any liquid.
2. For grease stains, sprinkle cornstarch directly on the stain and let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb the oil. Vacuum off the cornstarch.
3. In a spray bottle, dissolve the baking soda in warm water, shaking until no granules remain.
4. Add the white vinegar slowly, allowing the fizzing to subside, then add the castile soap and hydrogen peroxide. Cap and shake gently.
5. Spray the stained area until damp but not soaking. Let the solution sit for 5 minutes.
6. Scrub with a soft-bristle brush in a circular motion, working from the outside of the stain toward the center to prevent spreading.
7. Blot with a clean microfiber towel, pressing firmly to lift the dissolved stain. Repeat spraying and blotting if needed.
8. Leave car windows open or run the ventilation system to help the seats dry completely within an hour.

## Why It Works

Different stain types require different chemical approaches, which is why this formula combines multiple active ingredients. Vinegar's acetic acid breaks down tannin-based stains from coffee, tea, and juice by disrupting the tannin molecules that bond to fabric fibers. Baking soda provides mild alkalinity that emulsifies food-based oils and protein stains. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer that breaks the chromophore bonds in colored stain compounds -- literally dismantling the molecules that give a stain its visible color. Castile soap reduces surface tension so the cleaning agents penetrate the tightly woven automotive upholstery fabric rather than sitting on top. Cornstarch in the pre-treatment step works through adsorption, pulling grease molecules out of fabric and into the starch granules where they can be vacuumed away.

## Tips

- Always blot stains, never rub. Rubbing pushes the stain deeper into the fabric and can spread it.
- Treat stains as quickly as possible. Fresh stains respond much better than set-in ones.
- For stubborn old stains, spray the solution and cover the area with a damp cloth for 30 minutes before scrubbing.
- Keep a small spray bottle of this solution in the trunk for roadside spill emergencies.
- Do not use this on leather or vinyl seats. Those materials need pH-neutral cleaners and dedicated conditioners.
