## Steps

1. Combine baking soda and activated charcoal in a mixing bowl. Stir until blended.
2. Add uncooked rice and stir.
3. Mix in dried lavender and dried lemon zest, crushing the herbs between your fingers to release their oils.
4. Add eucalyptus essential oil drops and stir to distribute.
5. Cut four 6-by-6-inch squares of breathable fabric (muslin, cheesecloth, or old cotton T-shirt).
6. Place about 1/3 cup of mixture in the center of each square.
7. Gather the corners and tie securely with twine or a rubber band.
8. Tuck 1 or 2 sachets into trunk corners where they will not roll around.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes both acidic and basic odor molecules. Activated charcoal traps odor compounds in its microscopic pores. Uncooked rice draws moisture from the air, reducing the humidity mildew needs to grow. Dried herbs and essential oils contribute antimicrobial terpenes that suppress odor-producing bacteria and mold.

## Tips

- Replace sachets every 4 to 6 weeks, or refresh with 5 drops of essential oil.
- Empty spent sachets into garden soil -- everything is compost-safe.
- If the trunk had a liquid spill, clean and dry the area first. Sachets cannot overcome an active odor source.
- These sachets also work under car seats, in gym bags, or in closets.
