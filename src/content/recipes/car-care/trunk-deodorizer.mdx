## Steps

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the baking soda and activated charcoal. Stir until evenly blended.
2. Add the uncooked rice and stir again. The rice adds bulk and absorbs ambient moisture.
3. Mix in the dried lavender and dried lemon zest. Crush the herbs lightly between your fingers as you add them to release their oils.
4. Add the eucalyptus essential oil drops and stir to distribute throughout the mixture.
5. Cut four squares of breathable fabric (muslin, cheesecloth, or an old cotton T-shirt), approximately 6 inches by 6 inches each.
6. Divide the mixture evenly among the four fabric squares, placing about 1/3 cup in the center of each.
7. Gather the corners of each square and tie securely with twine or a rubber band, forming a small pouch.
8. Place 1 or 2 sachets in the trunk, tucking them into corners or along the sides where they will not roll around.

## Why It Works

Trunk odors come from two sources: trapped volatile organic compounds (from groceries, sports gear, spills, and cargo) and moisture that enables mildew growth in the enclosed space. Baking soda neutralizes both acidic and basic odor molecules through an acid-base reaction, making it effective against the widest range of smells. Activated charcoal adsorbs odor molecules through physical trapping in its vast network of microscopic pores -- a single gram of activated charcoal has a surface area of up to 3,000 square meters. Uncooked rice is hygroscopic, drawing moisture out of the trunk air and reducing the humidity that mildew needs to grow. The dried herbs and essential oils do not just mask smells; they contain terpenes and phenolic compounds that have mild antimicrobial properties, helping to suppress the bacteria and mold that produce odors in the first place.

## Tips

- Replace sachets every 4 to 6 weeks, or refresh them by adding 5 drops of essential oil and shaking.
- After the sachets lose their effectiveness, empty the contents into your garden soil. Everything in them is compost-safe.
- For a quick trunk refresh between sachet changes, sprinkle plain baking soda on the trunk carpet, let it sit for 30 minutes, and vacuum.
- If your trunk had a liquid spill, clean and dry the area first. Sachets control ambient odor but cannot overcome an active source.
- These sachets also work well under car seats, in gym bags, or in closets.
