## Steps

1. **For the under-seat sachet:** Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda into a small bowl.
2. Add 10 drops of essential oil and stir with a fork until evenly distributed.
3. Spoon the scented baking soda into the muslin bag and tie it closed.
4. Place the sachet under the driver or passenger seat where it will not slide around.
5. **For the vent clip version:** Place 5 drops of essential oil onto the felt or fabric circle.
6. Let the felt absorb the oil for 2 minutes, then attach it to a vent clip or tuck it behind the vent slats.
7. Refresh both versions with 3 to 5 drops of essential oil every 1 to 2 weeks.

## Why It Works

Baking soda reacts with both acidic and basic odor molecules, neutralizing them rather than masking them with fragrance. Essential oils provide scent from plant-derived compounds that evaporate slowly at room temperature. The vent clip version uses cabin airflow to distribute scent without aerosol propellants.

## Alternative

- Fill the mason jar with baking soda and essential oil, cover with breathable fabric secured by a rubber band, and place it in a cup holder.
- Substitute activated charcoal for baking soda if you want odor absorption without any added scent.

## Tips

- Peppermint oil helps with alertness during long drives. Lavender is better for relaxing commutes.
- Replace the baking soda sachet every 4 to 6 weeks.
- For persistent odors (mildew, smoke, pet smell), sprinkle plain baking soda on carpets and floor mats, let it sit for 30 minutes, then vacuum before placing the freshener.
- Avoid synthetic fragrance oils. Check that the label says "100% pure essential oil."
