## Steps

1. **For the under-seat sachet:** Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda into a small bowl.
2. Add 10 drops of your chosen essential oil to the baking soda and stir with a fork until evenly distributed.
3. Spoon the scented baking soda into the muslin bag or breathable pouch and tie it closed.
4. Place the sachet under the driver or passenger seat where it will not slide around.
5. **For the vent clip version:** Place 5 drops of essential oil onto the felt or fabric circle.
6. Let the felt absorb the oil for 2 minutes, then attach it to a vent clip or tuck it behind the vent slats.
7. Refresh both versions with 3 to 5 additional drops of essential oil every 1 to 2 weeks as the scent fades.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is an amphoteric compound, meaning it reacts with both acidic and basic odor molecules. Rather than layering a fragrance on top of stale smells the way synthetic fresheners do, baking soda neutralizes the volatile compounds that cause the odor in the first place. The essential oils provide genuine fragrance from plant-derived terpenes and alcohols that evaporate slowly at room temperature. Placing the felt on a vent clip uses the airflow from the climate system to distribute the scent evenly throughout the cabin without any aerosol propellants or phthalate-based fragrance carriers.

## Alternative

- Fill the small mason jar with baking soda and essential oil, cover with a piece of breathable fabric secured with a rubber band, and place it in a cup holder for a visible freshener option.
- Substitute activated charcoal for baking soda if you want odor absorption without any added scent. Activated charcoal has roughly 10 times the surface area of baking soda per gram and is excellent at trapping volatile organic compounds.
## Tips

- Peppermint oil has the added benefit of helping with alertness during long drives. Lavender is better for relaxing commutes.
- Replace the baking soda sachet every 4 to 6 weeks. After that point, the baking soda becomes saturated and stops absorbing odors effectively.
- If your car has a persistent odor (mildew, smoke, pet smell), sprinkle plain baking soda directly on the carpets and floor mats, let it sit for 30 minutes, then vacuum it up before placing the freshener.
- Avoid synthetic fragrance oils sold as essential oils. Check that the label says "100% pure essential oil" -- synthetic versions contain phthalates and synthetic musks.
