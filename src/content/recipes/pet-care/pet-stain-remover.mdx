yield: "32 oz bottle"
ingredients:
  - name: "Citrus peels"
    amount: "2 cups"
    notes: "orange, lemon, or grapefruit — loosely packed"
  - name: "Brown sugar"
    amount: "1/2 cup"

safetyWarnings:
  - "Citrus oils are toxic to cats — do not use this product on surfaces cats will lick or lie on directly"
  - "Release gas daily during fermentation by loosening the lid — pressure can build and burst a sealed container"
  - "The fermentation process produces a mild yeasty odor that is normal and temporary"
  - "Test on an inconspicuous area of carpet or upholstery first — citrus enzymes can lighten some fabrics"

## Steps

1. Chop the citrus peels into small pieces (about 1-inch squares) and place them in a large plastic bottle or jar. Do not use a glass jar with a tight seal — you need to release gas.
2. Dissolve the brown sugar in the water by stirring until fully incorporated.
3. Pour the sugar water over the citrus peels. The peels should be fully submerged.
4. Loosely cap the container — leave the lid slightly open or cover with cheesecloth secured by a rubber band.
5. Store the container in a warm, dark place for 14 days. Once daily, stir or swirl the mixture and release any built-up gas.
6. After 14 days, strain out the peels through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. The liquid should smell tangy and citrusy.
7. Add the baking soda to the strained liquid and stir. Transfer to a spray bottle.
8. To use on stains, blot up as much of the pet accident as possible, then saturate the area with the enzyme spray. Cover with a damp towel and let it work for 30-60 minutes before blotting dry.

## Why It Works

This recipe harnesses natural fermentation to produce enzymes. The wild yeasts and bacteria present on citrus peels feed on the brown sugar, producing protease and lipase enzymes as metabolic byproducts. These enzymes break down the proteins (uric acid crystals, urea) and lipids in pet urine into smaller, water-soluble compounds that can be blotted away. Commercial enzymatic cleaners use the same principle but with lab-cultured enzymes. The citrus peels contribute d-limonene, a powerful natural solvent that cuts through organic residue. Baking soda added after fermentation provides immediate odor neutralization while the slower-acting enzymes work on the stain over time.

## Tips

- This cleaner improves with age. Store the strained liquid in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.
- For old, set-in stains, apply the spray and cover with plastic wrap overnight to prevent evaporation while the enzymes work.
- Works on carpet, hardwood (sealed), tile grout, and concrete — anywhere pet stains accumulate.
- If the fermentation develops mold on the surface, skim it off. A thin white film (kahm yeast) is normal and harmless.
- For dog-only households, this is safe on all surfaces. For cat households, use only on floors and areas cats do not directly contact.
