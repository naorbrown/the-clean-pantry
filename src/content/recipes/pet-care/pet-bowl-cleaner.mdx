## Steps

1. Empty and rinse the pet bowls to remove loose food debris.
2. Fill a basin or your kitchen sink with 4 cups of hot water (not boiling -- just the hottest your tap produces).
3. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar and stir.
4. Add 2 tablespoons of coarse salt and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Stir until dissolved.
5. Submerge the pet bowls in the solution and let them soak for 15 minutes.
6. After soaking, use a dedicated sponge or brush (not the one you use for your own dishes) to scrub the inside of each bowl, paying special attention to the bottom and any scratched areas where bacteria hide.
7. Rinse each bowl thoroughly under running water until no vinegar smell remains.
8. Air dry upside down on a clean towel or drying rack.

## Why It Works

Pet bowls develop biofilm -- a slimy layer of bacteria, yeast, and mold -- within 24 hours of use. This biofilm is the main cause of the slippery residue you feel on water bowls. White vinegar's acetic acid breaks down biofilm by disrupting the polysaccharide matrix that holds the bacterial colony together. Coarse salt provides gentle physical abrasion during scrubbing that removes biofilm without scratching stainless steel or ceramic surfaces. Baking soda is a mild alkaline abrasive that helps lift stuck-on food residue and deodorizes the bowl. Hot water accelerates all of these reactions and helps dissolve grease from wet food residue.

## Alternative

For a quick daily clean when you do not have time for a full soak, sprinkle a pinch of coarse salt into the bowl, add a splash of vinegar, and scrub with a brush for 30 seconds. Rinse thoroughly. This is not a substitute for the full soak but keeps biofilm from building up between deep cleans.
## Tips

- Clean pet bowls daily. The FDA recommends washing pet food dishes after every meal, just like human dishes.
- Stainless steel and ceramic bowls are easier to fully sanitize than plastic. Plastic develops micro-scratches over time that harbor bacteria even after cleaning.
- Replace plastic bowls every 6-12 months, or sooner if you see visible scratches.
- Wash water bowls just as often as food bowls. Standing water grows bacteria rapidly.
- Use a separate sponge for pet bowls to avoid cross-contamination with your own dishes.
- This solution also works well for cleaning pet water fountains. Disassemble the fountain fully before soaking.
