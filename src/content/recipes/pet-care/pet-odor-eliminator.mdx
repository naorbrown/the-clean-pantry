## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
3. Slowly add 1 tablespoon of baking soda. The mixture will fizz -- wait for it to subside before continuing.
4. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.
5. Cap the bottle once all fizzing has stopped completely. Capping too early can cause pressure buildup.
6. Shake gently before each use.
7. Spray liberally onto the odor source -- pet beds, couch cushions, carpet spots, or anywhere pet odor lingers.
8. Allow the sprayed area to air dry. Do not wipe immediately; the solution needs time to neutralize the odor compounds.

## Why It Works

Pet odors are primarily caused by bacteria breaking down organic compounds in urine, saliva, and skin oils, producing volatile amines and sulfur compounds. White vinegar's acetic acid neutralizes alkaline odor molecules (particularly the ammonia compounds in urine) through an acid-base reaction, converting them into odorless salts. Baking soda is an amphoteric compound, meaning it reacts with both acids and bases, allowing it to neutralize a broader range of odor-causing molecules than vinegar alone. Lemon juice adds citric acid, which is effective against sulfur-based odors and leaves a clean scent as the spray dries.

## Alternative

For a carpet powder deodorizer, mix 1 cup of baking soda with 10 drops of lavender essential oil (safe around dogs; keep cats away during application). Sprinkle on carpets, let it sit for 30 minutes, and vacuum thoroughly. This works well for general pet smell rather than specific stain odors.
## Tips

- For fresh urine stains, blot up as much liquid as possible first, then spray generously and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before blotting again.
- The vinegar smell dissipates completely as the spray dries, usually within an hour.
- For deep odors embedded in carpet padding, you may need to saturate the area and let it dry fully. Repeat 2-3 times for severe odors.
- Make a fresh batch every 2 weeks for best effectiveness.
- Keep a bottle near the litter box area for quick spot treatments.
