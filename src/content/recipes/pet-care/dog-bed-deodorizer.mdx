## Steps

1. Combine the baking soda and cornstarch in a bowl and whisk until evenly blended.
2. Crush the dried lavender buds and rosemary between your fingers or with a mortar and pestle to release their oils.
3. Add the crushed herbs and the food-grade diatomaceous earth to the bowl and stir to distribute evenly.
4. Transfer the powder to a shaker container — a large spice jar or a mason jar with a perforated lid works well.
5. Remove any blankets or covers from the dog bed. Sprinkle the powder generously over the entire surface of the bed.
6. Use your hands or a soft brush to gently work the powder into the fabric.
7. Let the powder sit for at least 20 minutes. For heavily odorous beds, leave it for up to an hour.
8. Vacuum the bed thoroughly using an upholstery attachment, making sure to get into seams and crevices.

## Why It Works

Dog odor comes primarily from sebaceous gland secretions — a waxy, oily substance that builds up in fabric fibers over time. Baking soda neutralizes the volatile fatty acids in these secretions that produce the characteristic "wet dog" smell. Cornstarch absorbs excess moisture and oils trapped in the bed's filling. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is a naturally desiccant powder made from fossilized algae that also absorbs oils and mechanically deters fleas by damaging their exoskeletons on contact. The crushed lavender and rosemary release small amounts of linalool and camphor, compounds that repel fleas and ticks while providing a pleasant, natural scent.

## Tips

- Apply this treatment weekly, or immediately after baths when the bed tends to get damp.
- Store the remaining powder in an airtight jar — it keeps for several months.
- For removable dog bed covers, you can also sprinkle powder inside the cover before washing to boost odor removal.
- If your dog has flea issues, increase the diatomaceous earth to 1/2 cup for extra flea-deterrent action.
- Vacuum slowly and in multiple passes — powder trapped deep in foam filling takes patience to remove.
