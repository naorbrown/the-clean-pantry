## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of apple cider vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of water.
3. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.
4. Add 1 tablespoon of witch hazel.
5. Cap the bottle and shake well to combine.
6. To apply, spray lightly onto your dog's coat, avoiding the face. Focus on the belly, legs, armpits, and base of the tail where fleas tend to congregate.
7. Rub the spray into the coat with your hands so it reaches the skin.

## Why It Works

Fleas strongly dislike acidic environments. Apple cider vinegar creates an acidic, unpleasant surface on your dog's coat and skin that repels fleas on contact. The acetic acid also has mild antiseptic properties. Lemon juice contains d-limonene, a natural compound found in citrus peels that is toxic to fleas but safe for dogs at these concentrations. Witch hazel acts as a natural astringent that helps the solution adhere to the coat longer rather than evaporating quickly, extending the repellent effect between applications.

## Alternative

For a flea-repellent bandana, soak a cotton bandana in a mixture of 2 cups water and 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar. Wring it out and let it air dry. Tie it loosely around your dog's neck. Re-soak weekly. This provides passive repellent protection around the head and neck area without spraying.
## Tips

- Apply before walks in grassy or wooded areas where flea exposure is likely.
- Reapply every 2-3 days during peak flea season (spring and summer).
- The vinegar smell fades within 30 minutes as the spray dries.
- Combine this spray with regular washing of pet bedding and vacuuming carpets for a comprehensive flea prevention approach.
- Test on a small patch of skin first and wait 24 hours to check for any irritation before full application.
- Store at room temperature. The solution keeps for up to 2 weeks.
