## Steps

1. Dispose of all old litter in a sealed bag. Scrape out any clumps stuck to the bottom or sides using a plastic scraper.
2. Take the empty litter box to a bathtub, utility sink, or outdoor area with a hose.
3. Fill the box with hot water and add the dish soap. Let it soak for 5 minutes to loosen residue.
4. Drain the soapy water and sprinkle the baking soda over the entire interior surface.
5. Pour the white vinegar over the baking soda — it will fizz vigorously and work into scratches and grooves where bacteria hide.
6. Use a dedicated brush or sponge to scrub the interior, paying extra attention to corners and the bottom where urine pools.
7. Add the hydrogen peroxide to a fresh round of hot water in the box. Let it sit for 5 minutes as a final sanitizing soak.
8. Rinse the litter box at least three times with clean water until there is absolutely no soap or vinegar scent remaining. Air dry completely before adding fresh litter.

## Why It Works

Cat urine contains urea, which bacteria convert into ammonia over time. That ammonia is responsible for the overwhelming smell of a neglected litter box. Baking soda directly neutralizes ammonia by reacting with it to form ammonium bicarbonate, an odorless compound. The effervescent reaction between vinegar and baking soda physically drives cleaning solution into microscopic scratches in plastic — scratches that harbor biofilm. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing sanitizer that kills common litter box bacteria including E. coli and Salmonella without leaving behind toxic residue. Dish soap lifts the oily urine film that coats the plastic over time. The combination of mechanical scrubbing, chemical neutralization, and oxidizing sanitation is far more effective than any single step alone.

## Tips

- Deep sanitize monthly. Between deep cleans, sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda on the bottom of the box before adding litter.
- Replace plastic litter boxes entirely every 6-12 months — scratches accumulate and become impossible to fully clean.
- Stainless steel litter boxes resist scratching and are easier to sanitize long-term, though they cost more upfront.
- If your cat avoids the box after cleaning, the rinse was not thorough enough. Cats have 200 million olfactory receptors and can detect trace cleaning scents humans cannot.
- Use a separate brush for the litter box — never use the same brush in your kitchen or bathroom.
