description: "A streak-free glass cleaner for aquarium exteriors that will not contaminate tank water"

totalTime: PT5M
yield: "16 oz spray bottle"
ingredients:
  - name: "Distilled water"
    amount: "1 cup"

safetyWarnings:
  - "Spray onto the cloth, NEVER directly onto the glass — overspray can drip into the tank and alter water chemistry"
  - "Never use this or any cleaner on the interior glass of an occupied aquarium — even vinegar can harm fish at concentrated levels"
  - "Keep paper towel lint away from the tank opening — fibers that enter the water can clog filters"
  - "Wash your hands before reaching into the tank for any reason after handling cleaning products"

## Steps

1. Pour the distilled water into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add the white vinegar and swirl gently.
3. Add the cornstarch and shake well until it dissolves. It may leave a slight cloudiness — this is normal and beneficial.
4. Before cleaning, cover the top of the aquarium with a towel to prevent any accidental drips from entering the tank.
5. Spray the solution onto a clean microfiber cloth — never directly onto the glass.
6. Wipe the exterior glass in a Z-pattern, working from top to bottom to avoid redepositing drips.
7. Buff with a dry section of the microfiber cloth to remove streaks.
8. Remove the protective towel from the tank top once you are completely finished and your hands are clean.

## Why It Works

Hard water stains on aquarium glass are calcium carbonate deposits left behind when splashed tank water evaporates. White vinegar's acetic acid reacts with calcium carbonate, dissolving it into soluble calcium acetate that wipes away cleanly. Distilled water prevents new mineral deposits from forming during cleaning — tap water would leave its own mineral residue behind. The cornstarch is the secret to a streak-free finish: its microscopic particles act as a gentle polishing compound that buffs the glass smooth, and the starch molecules fill in tiny surface imperfections so light passes through evenly rather than scattering into visible streaks.

## Tips

- Shake the bottle before every use — the cornstarch settles to the bottom.
- For heavy calcium buildup, soak a cloth in undiluted white vinegar and hold it against the exterior glass for 5 minutes before wiping.
- Acrylic aquariums scratch easily. For acrylic, skip the cornstarch and use only the vinegar-water mix with an extra-soft cloth.
- Clean the exterior weekly to prevent mineral buildup from becoming difficult to remove.
- This solution also works well on glass terrariums and reptile enclosures — always spray onto the cloth, not the habitat.
