## Steps

1. Bring the distilled water to a simmer (not a full boil) in a small saucepan.
2. Remove from heat, add the dried rosemary and peppermint, and cover. Let the herbs steep for 30-45 minutes to create a strong herbal infusion.
3. Strain the infusion through a fine mesh strainer, pressing the herbs to extract all the liquid. Discard the spent herbs.
4. Combine the herbal infusion with the apple cider vinegar in a clean 4 oz spray bottle.
5. Add the fresh lemon juice and vegetable glycerin. Shake gently to combine.
6. To refresh a flea collar or bandana, remove it from your dog, lay it flat, and spray both sides lightly until damp. Let it air dry completely before putting it back on your dog.
7. Reapply every 3-5 days, or after your dog gets wet.

## Why It Works

Fleas navigate primarily by scent, and several botanical compounds are known to repel them. Rosemary contains camphor and cineole, which fleas find irritating to their chemoreceptors. Peppermint contributes menthol, another strong flea deterrent that disrupts the insect's ability to locate a host. Apple cider vinegar changes the scent profile of the collar's fabric, making it less appealing to fleas — the acetic acid creates an environment fleas actively avoid. Lemon juice contains d-limonene, the same compound used in many commercial flea products, which is toxic to fleas on contact but safe for dogs. Vegetable glycerin helps the botanical compounds adhere to the collar fabric rather than evaporating immediately.

## Tips

- For best results, use this spray alongside regular grooming and flea combing rather than as a standalone solution.
- The herbal infusion can be made in larger batches and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
- If your dog wears a fabric bandana instead of a collar, this spray works identically — just ensure the bandana dries fully before wearing.
- During peak flea season (warm, humid months), refresh every 2-3 days.
- You can also lightly spray this on your dog's bedding as an additional deterrent layer.
