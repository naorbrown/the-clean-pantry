## Steps

1. Vacuum the entire cat tree thoroughly using an upholstery attachment. Get into all crevices, platforms, and the base of sisal posts where hair accumulates.
2. Combine the warm water, white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and dish soap in a spray bottle and shake gently.
3. Sprinkle baking soda generously over all carpeted and plush surfaces on the cat tree. Work it into the fibers with a brush.
4. Let the baking soda sit for 15-20 minutes to absorb oils and odors.
5. Vacuum up the baking soda completely.
6. Lightly mist the carpeted surfaces and platforms with the spray solution. Do not soak — the goal is damp, not wet.
7. For sisal-wrapped posts, spray the cloth and wipe the sisal down in the direction of the wrap. Avoid saturating the sisal, which dries slowly.
8. Wipe all surfaces with a clean, damp cloth to remove residue. Place the cat tree near a window or fan and let it air dry fully before your cat uses it again.

## Why It Works

Cat trees accumulate a complex mix of contaminants: skin oils from paw pads, saliva from grooming, shed fur, dander, and occasionally urine marking. Baking soda applied as a dry treatment first absorbs the oily sebaceous secretions that trap odors in carpet fibers — these oils are what make the "used cat tree smell" linger even after vacuuming. The vinegar spray neutralizes ammonia from any urine marking, while the dish soap's surfactants break up the protein-and-oil film left by repeated paw contact. Hydrogen peroxide acts as a mild sanitizer that eliminates bacteria and fungal spores (including ringworm, which cats can carry asymptomatically) without leaving toxic residue. The two-phase approach — dry treatment followed by wet spray — is more effective than either alone.

## Tips

- Deep clean monthly, or more frequently in multi-cat households.
- Between deep cleans, a quick vacuum and baking soda sprinkle every week keeps odors under control.
- If the sisal rope is fraying or unraveling, you can re-wrap it yourself with new sisal from a hardware store — it is much cheaper than replacing the whole tree.
- Cats prefer scratching posts that carry their scent, so avoid over-cleaning. A monthly deep clean strikes the right balance between hygiene and familiarity.
- For persistent urine marking on the base, the enzymatic pet stain remover recipe in this collection is more effective than this general cleaner.
