## Steps

1. If using whole rolled oats, grind them in a blender or food processor until they become a fine powder. This is your colloidal oatmeal.
2. Combine the liquid castile soap and water in a clean squeeze bottle or recycled shampoo bottle.
3. Add the colloidal oatmeal, vegetable glycerin, and apple cider vinegar.
4. Cap the bottle and shake gently until everything is well mixed. Avoid shaking too vigorously -- castile soap foams easily.
5. To use, wet your pet thoroughly with warm water. Apply a quarter-sized amount of shampoo and work it into a lather, starting from the neck and moving toward the tail.
6. Massage into the coat for 2-3 minutes to allow the oatmeal to soothe the skin.
7. Rinse completely with warm water. Leftover soap residue can cause itching and flaking.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a true soap made from plant oils (typically olive or coconut), which means it cleans effectively without synthetic detergents like sodium lauryl sulfate that can strip a pet's skin of natural oils. Colloidal oatmeal contains beta-glucans and avenanthramides, compounds that reduce itching and inflammation on contact. The vegetable glycerin acts as a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin and coat. Apple cider vinegar restores the skin's natural pH balance (dogs have a skin pH around 6.2-7.4, which is more neutral than human skin) and adds a light conditioning effect that reduces tangles.

## Alternative

For a quick dry shampoo between baths, mix equal parts baking soda and cornstarch. Sprinkle it into your pet's coat, massage it down to the skin, wait 5 minutes, then brush it out thoroughly. This absorbs excess oil and neutralizes odors without water.
## Tips

- Shake the bottle before each use -- the oatmeal tends to settle.
- For dogs with very dry or flaky skin, increase the colloidal oatmeal to 3 tablespoons.
- Store in the shower or bathroom at room temperature. Use within 4 weeks since there are no preservatives.
- Bathe dogs no more than once every 2-4 weeks unless directed by a vet. Over-bathing strips natural skin oils regardless of what shampoo you use.
- For cats, bathing is rarely necessary. Consult your vet before bathing a cat, and never use any product containing essential oils on felines.
