## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of activated charcoal powder in a mixing bowl.
2. If desired, add 5 drops of lemon essential oil and stir.
3. Divide the mixture between two small mason jars or open containers.
4. Cover each jar with cheesecloth or breathable fabric. Secure with a rubber band or jar ring.
5. Place one jar on the top shelf and one on the bottom shelf.
6. Replace every 30 days. Pour spent mixture down the drain with hot water to freshen it.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes both acidic and alkaline odor molecules on contact. Activated charcoal traps odor molecules in its extremely porous surface through adsorption. Together they tackle odors through both chemical neutralization and physical trapping.

## Tips

- Use wide-mouth containers to maximize surface area exposed to air.
- Do not use scented baking soda from the store — fragrances can transfer to uncovered food.
- For a freezer, skip the essential oil — the scent can cling to frozen foods.
