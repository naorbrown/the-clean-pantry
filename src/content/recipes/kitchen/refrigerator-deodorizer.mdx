## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of activated charcoal powder in a mixing bowl. Stir thoroughly to distribute the charcoal evenly throughout the baking soda.
2. If desired, add 5 drops of lemon essential oil and stir again. The oil adds a subtle fresh scent without overpowering food aromas.
3. Divide the mixture evenly between two small mason jars or open containers.
4. Cover each jar with a small piece of cheesecloth or breathable fabric. Secure the fabric with a rubber band or the jar ring. The cloth keeps the powder contained while allowing air to flow through.
5. Place one jar on the top shelf and one on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator for maximum coverage.
6. Replace the deodorizer mixture every 30 days for best results. Spent baking soda can be poured down the drain with hot water to freshen it.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is amphoteric, meaning it can react with both acidic and alkaline odor molecules. Most fridge odors are volatile fatty acids from food decomposition, and baking soda neutralizes these acids on contact rather than simply masking them. Activated charcoal works through adsorption — its extremely porous surface (one gram has roughly 3,000 square meters of surface area) traps odor molecules in microscopic pores, physically removing them from the air. Together, the two ingredients tackle odors through both chemical neutralization and physical trapping, making them far more effective than either ingredient alone.

## Tips

- Use wide-mouth containers rather than narrow ones to maximize the surface area exposed to air circulation.
- Do not use scented baking soda from the store — it often contains fragrances that can transfer to uncovered food.
- After 30 days, repurpose the spent mixture by sprinkling it in the garbage disposal or trash can for extra deodorizing.
- For a freezer, use the same recipe but skip the essential oil — frozen air carries fewer odor molecules, and the oil scent can cling to frozen foods.
