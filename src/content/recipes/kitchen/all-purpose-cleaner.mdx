## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of water.
3. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake gently to combine.
4. Spray the solution onto the surface you want to clean.
5. Let it sit for 1-2 minutes.
6. Wipe clean with a microfiber cloth or paper towel.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid disrupts bacterial cell membranes on contact. It also dissolves mineral deposits and cuts through light grease. Diluting with water keeps the solution safe for everyday surfaces.

## Alternative

- Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil for extra antimicrobial power.
- Substitute lemon juice for half the vinegar for a citrus scent and additional grease-cutting ability.

## Tips

- Use distilled water if you have hard tap water to avoid mineral spots.
- This solution keeps indefinitely at room temperature.
