## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar into a clean 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 cup of water.
3. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake gently to combine.
4. Spray the solution onto the surface you want to clean.
5. Let it sit for 1-2 minutes.
6. Wipe clean with a microfiber cloth or paper towel.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid (around pH 2.0) disrupts the cell membranes of common household bacteria, effectively killing them on contact. The acid also dissolves mineral deposits and cuts through light grease, making it effective on a wide range of kitchen messes. Diluting with water brings the solution to a safe concentration for everyday surfaces while keeping it potent enough to clean.

## Alternative

- Add 10 drops of tea tree essential oil for extra antimicrobial power. Tea tree oil has natural antifungal and antibacterial properties that complement the vinegar.
- Substitute lemon juice for half the vinegar if you prefer a citrus scent and want additional grease-cutting ability.

## Tips

- Use distilled water if you have hard tap water to avoid leaving mineral spots.
- Do not use on marble, granite, or natural stone -- the acid will etch and dull the surface over time.
- This solution keeps indefinitely at room temperature. No need to refrigerate.
