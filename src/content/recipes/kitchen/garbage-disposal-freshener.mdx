## Steps

1. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup of table salt. Mix well.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of lemon zest to the dry mixture and stir to distribute evenly.
3. Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup of lemon juice while stirring. The mixture will fizz — this is normal. Add the juice gradually to prevent it from overflowing the bowl. Stir until it reaches a consistency like damp sand that holds together when pressed.
4. Pack the mixture firmly into an ice cube tray or silicone mold. Press it down hard with a spoon to compress each pod.
5. Let the pods dry at room temperature for at least 12 hours, or until they are completely hard and dry throughout. They should not crumble when removed from the mold.
6. Pop the pods out and store them in an airtight glass jar.
7. **To use:** Drop 1 pod into the garbage disposal. Turn on cold water at a moderate flow. Run the disposal until the fizzing stops and the pod is fully dissolved (about 20 to 30 seconds).

## Why It Works

Baking soda and citric acid (from the lemon juice) react when exposed to water, producing carbon dioxide gas. This fizzing action physically dislodges food particles stuck to the disposal walls, splash guard, and grinding components. Baking soda also neutralizes acidic odor compounds — the primary culprits behind disposal stench are volatile fatty acids from decomposing food. Salt acts as a mild abrasive that scours the grinding chamber and helps break down grease buildup. The lemon zest contains limonene, a natural solvent and deodorizer that leaves a fresh citrus scent and helps cut through oily residue.

## Tips

- Use these pods once a week for routine maintenance. If your disposal has a persistent odor, use one pod daily for 3 to 4 days to clear the buildup, then switch to weekly.
- Always run cold water, not hot, when using the disposal. Cold water solidifies grease so the blades can chop it up, while hot water melts grease and allows it to coat the drain pipe.
- If the mixture is too wet and will not hold its shape, add more baking soda 1 tablespoon at a time until it packs firmly.
- These pods keep for 2 to 3 months in an airtight container. Exposure to humidity will cause them to fizz prematurely and lose potency.
- Toss the spent lemon halves (after zesting and juicing) directly into the disposal for extra cleaning. Citrus rinds help deodorize and the natural oils clean the splash guard.

## Alternative

- For an immediate freshener without pre-made pods, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda directly into the disposal, followed by 1/2 cup of vinegar. Let it fizz for 5 minutes, then flush with cold water while running the disposal.
- Freeze white vinegar in ice cube trays and run 3 to 4 vinegar ice cubes through the disposal with cold water. The ice helps knock debris off the grinding components while the vinegar deodorizes.
