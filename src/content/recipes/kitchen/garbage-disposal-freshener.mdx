## Steps

1. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup of table salt. Mix well.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of lemon zest to the dry mixture and stir to distribute evenly.
3. Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup of lemon juice while stirring. The mixture will fizz. Stir until it reaches a damp-sand consistency that holds together when pressed.
4. Pack the mixture firmly into an ice cube tray or silicone mold.
5. Let the pods dry at room temperature for at least 12 hours, until completely hard.
6. Pop the pods out and store them in an airtight glass jar.
7. **To use:** Drop 1 pod into the garbage disposal. Turn on cold water at a moderate flow. Run the disposal until the fizzing stops and the pod is fully dissolved (about 20 to 30 seconds).

## Why It Works

Baking soda and citric acid react in water, producing carbon dioxide that dislodges food particles from the disposal walls and splash guard. Baking soda neutralizes acidic odor compounds from decomposing food. Salt scours the grinding chamber and breaks down grease. Lemon zest contains limonene, a natural solvent and deodorizer.

## Alternative

- For an immediate freshener without pre-made pods, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda directly into the disposal, followed by 1/2 cup of vinegar. Let it fizz for 5 minutes, then flush with cold water while running the disposal.
- Freeze white vinegar in ice cube trays and run 3 to 4 vinegar ice cubes through the disposal with cold water. The ice helps knock debris off the grinding components while the vinegar deodorizes.
## Tips

- Use one pod weekly. For persistent odors, use daily for 3-4 days, then switch to weekly.
- Always run cold water when using the disposal — it solidifies grease so the blades can chop it up.
- If the mixture is too wet, add more baking soda 1 tablespoon at a time.
- Pods keep 2-3 months in an airtight container. Humidity causes premature fizzing.
