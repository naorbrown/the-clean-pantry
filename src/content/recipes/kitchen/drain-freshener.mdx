## Steps

1. Remove the drain strainer or stopper from the kitchen sink.
2. Pour 1/2 cup of baking soda directly into the drain opening, pushing it down with a spoon if needed.
3. Slowly pour 1/2 cup of white vinegar into the drain and let it fizz.
4. Cover the drain with a wet cloth or stopper. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
5. Bring 4 cups of water to a rolling boil.
6. Remove the cloth and carefully pour the boiling water down the drain.
7. Optionally, drop 5 drops of lemon essential oil into the drain for a fresh scent.

## Why It Works

Baking soda neutralizes acidic odor compounds on contact. The carbon dioxide fizz from the vinegar reaction loosens buildup clinging to pipe walls. Boiling water melts and washes away softened grease and dislodged debris.

## Alternative

- For garbage disposals, freeze 1/2 cup of white vinegar in an ice cube tray. Drop the vinegar ice cubes into the running disposal along with a handful of coarse salt. The ice sharpens the blades while the vinegar and salt scour the chamber.
- Replace white vinegar with lemon juice for a stronger citrus deodorizing effect. Use the same amount.
- For persistent odors, repeat this treatment two days in a row.

## Tips

- Do this once a week as preventive maintenance.
- Never pour boiling water into old or damaged PVC pipes — use very hot tap water instead.
- If water drains slowly, you need a drain snake, not this treatment.
- After the treatment, run cold water for 30 seconds to solidify remaining grease so it flushes away.
