## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a microwave-safe glass bowl or measuring cup.
2. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice from both halves into the water. Drop the squeezed lemon halves into the bowl.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to the bowl.
4. Place the bowl in the center of the microwave.
5. Microwave on high for 5 minutes.
6. Keep the door closed for 2-3 more minutes to let the steam soften splatters.
7. Carefully remove the bowl using oven mitts.
8. Wipe down the interior walls, ceiling, and turntable with a damp cloth.
9. Remove the turntable and wash it separately if needed.

## Why It Works

Steam rehydrates dried food splatters so they wipe away without scrubbing. Vinegar vaporizes with the steam, cutting through grease on the walls. Lemon juice dissolves food stains, and the rind oils deodorize naturally.

## Alternative

- If you do not have a lemon, use 2 tablespoons of lemon juice from a bottle, or substitute with 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Baking soda does not add acid but is an excellent deodorizer.
- Orange or lime slices work as a substitute for lemon with similar results. Any citrus fruit provides citric acid and natural fragrance.
## Tips

- For heavy buildup, microwave for 7 minutes and let it steam for 5 minutes with the door closed.
- A quick 3-minute steam once a week prevents heavy buildup.
- Burnt popcorn or fish smells may need two rounds — these odors absorb into the plastic liner.
- Save the lemon halves to scrub the sink or deodorize the garbage disposal.
