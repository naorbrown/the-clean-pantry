## Steps

1. Pour 1 cup of water into a microwave-safe glass bowl or measuring cup.
2. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice from both halves into the water. Drop the squeezed lemon halves into the bowl.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to the bowl.
4. Place the bowl in the center of the microwave.
5. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. The solution will come to a rolling boil, and steam will coat the interior walls.
6. Do not open the door immediately. Let the bowl sit inside with the door closed for 2 to 3 minutes. The trapped steam continues to soften baked-on food splatters.
7. Carefully remove the bowl using oven mitts.
8. Wipe down the interior walls, ceiling, and turntable with a damp cloth or sponge. Caked-on food should wipe away easily without scrubbing.
9. Remove the turntable and wash it separately in the sink with dish soap if needed.

## Why It Works

Heating the water creates steam that condenses on the microwave's interior surfaces. This moisture rehydrates dried food splatters, softening them so they can be wiped away without abrasive scrubbing. Vinegar's acetic acid vaporizes along with the steam, providing mild disinfecting action and cutting through grease on the walls. Lemon juice adds citric acid, which is effective at dissolving mineral deposits and food stains, and the lemon oil released from the rinds provides natural deodorizing. Together, the steam and acids do the hard work — your job is just to wipe.

## Alternative

- If you do not have a lemon, use 2 tablespoons of lemon juice from a bottle, or substitute with 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Baking soda does not add acid but is an excellent deodorizer.
- Orange or lime slices work as a substitute for lemon with similar results. Any citrus fruit provides citric acid and natural fragrance.
## Tips

- If your microwave is heavily soiled, microwave the solution for 7 minutes instead of 5, and let it steam for 5 minutes with the door closed.
- Do not skip the resting period. Opening the door immediately releases the steam and reduces the softening time on stuck-on food.
- Clean the microwave weekly to prevent heavy buildup. A quick 3-minute steam once a week keeps the interior nearly spotless.
- Save the lemon halves after cleaning — you can use them to scrub the sink or deodorize the garbage disposal.
- If your microwave smells like burnt popcorn or fish, repeat the process twice. These odors are absorbed into the plastic liner and may need multiple steam treatments.
- For a quick daily maintenance wipe, keep a spray bottle of equal parts water and vinegar near the microwave and wipe splatters immediately after they happen.
