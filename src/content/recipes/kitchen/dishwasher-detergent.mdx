## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup washing soda, 1/2 cup baking soda, 1/2 cup citric acid, and 1/4 cup coarse salt in a mixing bowl. Stir with a fork to break up clumps.
2. Add water one tablespoon at a time while stirring. Stop as soon as the mixture clumps when squeezed — too much water activates the citric acid prematurely.
3. Press the mixture firmly into a silicone ice cube tray or mini muffin tin.
4. Let the tablets dry undisturbed for 24 hours in a low-humidity location.
5. Pop the tablets out and store in an airtight glass jar.
6. Place one tablet in the detergent compartment and run a normal cycle. Use white vinegar in the rinse aid compartment for spot-free results.

## Why It Works

Washing soda is a strong alkaline cleaner that breaks down grease and protein-based food residue. Baking soda provides mild abrasion and neutralizes food odors. Citric acid dissolves hard water deposits and prevents cloudy film on glassware. Coarse salt scours stuck-on food and softens water.

## Alternative

- If you have very hard water, increase the citric acid to 3/4 cup and decrease the baking soda to 1/4 cup. The extra acid will better combat mineral buildup.
- For a powder version instead of tablets, skip the water entirely and store the dry mixture in a jar. Use 1 tablespoon per load.
- Add 5 drops of lemon essential oil per tablet for scent, mixing it in with the water in step 2.

## Tips

- Do not confuse washing soda with baking soda. Washing soda is significantly more alkaline and is the primary cleaning agent.
- Store in a sealed container. If tablets start to crumble or feel soft, they have absorbed moisture.
- If glasses come out with a white film, add more vinegar to the rinse aid or increase citric acid in your next batch.
- May not dissolve fully in quick or eco cycles with lower water temperatures.
