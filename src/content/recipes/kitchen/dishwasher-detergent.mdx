## Steps

1. Combine 1 cup washing soda, 1/2 cup baking soda, 1/2 cup citric acid, and 1/4 cup coarse salt in a mixing bowl. Stir thoroughly with a fork to break up any clumps.
2. Add water one tablespoon at a time while stirring. The mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand but still feel slightly crumbly. Stop adding water as soon as it clumps -- too much will activate the citric acid prematurely.
3. Press the mixture firmly into a silicone ice cube tray or mini muffin tin, packing each cavity tightly.
4. Let the tablets dry undisturbed for 24 hours in a low-humidity location.
5. Pop the tablets out of the mold and store in an airtight glass jar or container.
6. To use, place one tablet in your dishwasher's detergent compartment and run a normal cycle. Use white vinegar in the rinse aid compartment for spot-free results.

## Why It Works

Washing soda (sodium carbonate, pH ~11.5) is a strong alkaline cleaner that breaks down grease and protein-based food residue through saponification. Baking soda provides mild abrasive action and helps neutralize food odors. Citric acid activates during the wash cycle to dissolve hard water mineral deposits and prevent cloudy film on glassware. The coarse salt acts as a gentle abrasive that scours stuck-on food particles and also softens water by displacing calcium and magnesium ions.

## Alternative

- If you have very hard water, increase the citric acid to 3/4 cup and decrease the baking soda to 1/4 cup. The extra acid will better combat mineral buildup.
- For a powder version instead of tablets, skip the water entirely and store the dry mixture in a jar. Use 1 tablespoon per load.
- Add 5 drops of lemon essential oil per tablet for scent, mixing it in with the water in step 2.

## Tips

- Do not confuse washing soda with baking soda. Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is significantly more alkaline and is the primary cleaning agent here. Baking soda alone will not clean effectively.
- Humidity is the enemy of these tablets. Store them in a sealed container with a tight lid. If they start to crumble or feel soft, they have absorbed moisture.
- If your glasses come out with a white film, add more vinegar to the rinse aid compartment or increase the citric acid in your next batch.
- These tablets work best in standard dishwashers. They may not dissolve fully in quick or eco cycles with lower water temperatures.
