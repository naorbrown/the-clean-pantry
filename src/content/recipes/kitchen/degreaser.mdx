## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of warm water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap and swirl gently to dissolve.
3. Slowly pour in 1/4 cup of white vinegar. The mixture may fizz slightly -- this is normal.
4. Attach the spray nozzle and shake gently.
5. Spray generously onto greasy surfaces (stovetop, range hood, backsplash).
6. Let sit for 2-3 minutes.
7. Wipe with a damp cloth, applying light pressure on stubborn spots.
8. Do a final wipe with a rinsed cloth to remove residue.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a surfactant that emulsifies grease, lifting oil molecules away from the surface. Vinegar adds mild acidity that dissolves mineral-based grime. Together they handle both organic grease and inorganic buildup.

## Alternative

- For baked-on grease that won't budge with a spray, make a thick paste from 2 tablespoons of baking soda and a few drops of water. Apply the paste, let it sit for 15 minutes, then scrub with a non-scratch sponge and rinse.
- Replace castile soap with plain dish soap (1 tsp) if castile soap is not available. The degreasing effect will be similar.

## Tips

- For heavy-duty jobs like range hood filters, soak the filter in a basin of this solution for 30 minutes before scrubbing.
