## Steps

1. Pour 2 cups of warm water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap and swirl gently to dissolve.
3. Slowly pour in 1/4 cup of white vinegar. The mixture may fizz slightly -- this is normal.
4. Attach the spray nozzle and shake gently.
5. Spray generously onto greasy surfaces (stovetop, range hood, backsplash).
6. Let sit for 2-3 minutes to allow the solution to break down the grease.
7. Wipe with a damp cloth, applying light pressure on stubborn spots.
8. Rinse the cloth and do a final wipe to remove any residue.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a surfactant -- it reduces the surface tension of water and emulsifies grease, lifting oil molecules away from the surface so they can be wiped off. The vinegar adds mild acidity that helps dissolve mineral-based grime and boosts the soap's cleaning power. Together they handle both organic grease and inorganic buildup without harsh chemicals.

## Alternative

- For baked-on grease that won't budge with a spray, make a thick paste from 2 tablespoons of baking soda and a few drops of water. Apply the paste, let it sit for 15 minutes, then scrub with a non-scratch sponge and rinse.
- Replace castile soap with plain dish soap (1 tsp) if castile soap is not available. The degreasing effect will be similar.

## Tips

- Always add the vinegar last. Mixing it directly with concentrated soap causes curdling (the acid reacts with the soap's oils).
- Warm water dissolves soap faster and improves grease-cutting performance.
- For heavy-duty jobs like range hood filters, soak the filter in a basin of this solution for 30 minutes before scrubbing.
