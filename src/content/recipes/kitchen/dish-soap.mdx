## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of liquid castile soap into a clean 16 oz squeeze bottle or pump dispenser.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar slowly, swirling gently as you pour. The mixture may become slightly cloudy -- this is normal.
3. Add 10 drops of lemon essential oil.
4. Fill the rest of the bottle with warm water, leaving about half an inch of headroom.
5. Cap the bottle and turn it upside down a few times to combine. Avoid shaking vigorously, which creates excessive foam.
6. To use, squirt a small amount onto a wet sponge or directly into a basin of warm water. A little goes a long way.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a true soap made from plant oils (typically olive, coconut, or hemp). Its molecules have a water-loving end and an oil-loving end, which lets it surround grease particles and lift them off dishes into the rinse water. The vinegar provides a mild acid that cuts through food film and helps prevent the soap from leaving a residue. Lemon essential oil contains d-limonene, a natural solvent found in citrus peels that boosts grease-cutting ability and leaves dishes smelling clean.

## Alternative

- Replace lemon essential oil with 15 drops of sweet orange or grapefruit oil for a different citrus scent with similar degreasing properties.
- For extra scrubbing power on baked-on food, add 1 teaspoon of washing soda (sodium carbonate) to the mixture. This raises the pH and improves grease removal but may be too harsh for delicate glassware.
- If you prefer unscented soap, simply omit the essential oil. The castile soap and vinegar alone clean effectively.

## Tips

- Castile soap does not produce the thick foam of commercial dish soaps. Less foam does not mean less cleaning power -- the surfactant action is what removes grease, not the bubbles.
- Shake the bottle gently before each use, as the ingredients may separate over time.
- This soap works best in warm or hot water. Cold water reduces the surfactant effectiveness of castile soap.
- Store at room temperature. The mixture keeps for 2-3 months without preservatives.
