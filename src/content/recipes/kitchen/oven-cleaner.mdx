## Steps

1. Remove the oven racks and set them aside.
2. Combine 1/2 cup baking soda with 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Stir until you have a thick, spreadable paste. Add water a teaspoon at a time if needed.
3. Spread the paste across the interior surfaces of the oven, focusing on areas with heavy buildup. Avoid the heating elements.
4. Close the oven door and leave the paste on for at least 8 hours or overnight.
5. The next day, dampen a cloth and wipe out as much of the dried paste as you can.
6. Spray white vinegar onto any remaining baking soda residue. It will foam on contact.
7. Wipe everything clean with a damp cloth. Repeat until no residue remains.
8. Replace the oven racks.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild alkali (pH ~8.3) that breaks down grease and baked-on food through a process called saponification -- it converts greasy residues into a form of soap that wipes away easily. The extended contact time allows the alkaline paste to penetrate and soften carbonized food deposits without any scrubbing. The vinegar spray at the end reacts with leftover baking soda, creating a fizzing action that lifts the final residue off the surface.

## Alternative

- For extremely stubborn spots, add 1 tablespoon of salt to the baking soda paste. The salt acts as a mild abrasive and helps the paste cling to vertical surfaces.
- If you need a faster result, heat the oven to 200F for 5 minutes before applying the paste (let it cool until warm to the touch). The warmth accelerates the chemical breakdown, cutting the wait time to 2-4 hours.

## Tips

- Clean your oven racks separately by soaking them in the bathtub with hot water and 1/2 cup of baking soda for 1-2 hours.
- The paste will turn brown as it absorbs grease. This means it is working.
- Do not use this method on ovens with a self-cleaning coating -- the abrasive paste can damage the specialized surface.
