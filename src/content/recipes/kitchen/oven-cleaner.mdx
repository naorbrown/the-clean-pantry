## Steps

1. Remove the oven racks and set them aside.
2. Combine 1/2 cup baking soda with 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Stir until you have a thick, spreadable paste.
3. Spread the paste across the interior surfaces, focusing on heavy buildup. Avoid the heating elements.
4. Close the oven door and leave the paste on for at least 8 hours or overnight.
5. Dampen a cloth and wipe out as much of the dried paste as you can.
6. Spray white vinegar onto any remaining residue and let it foam.
7. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Repeat until no residue remains.
8. Replace the oven racks.

## Why It Works

Baking soda is a mild alkali that converts greasy residues into a form of soap that wipes away easily. Extended contact time softens carbonized food deposits without scrubbing. The vinegar spray reacts with leftover baking soda, fizzing to lift the final residue.

## Alternative

- For extremely stubborn spots, add 1 tablespoon of salt to the baking soda paste. The salt acts as a mild abrasive and helps the paste cling to vertical surfaces.
- If you need a faster result, heat the oven to 200F for 5 minutes before applying the paste (let it cool until warm to the touch). The warmth accelerates the chemical breakdown, cutting the wait time to 2-4 hours.

## Tips

- Clean oven racks separately by soaking them in the bathtub with hot water and 1/2 cup of baking soda for 1-2 hours.
- The paste will turn brown as it absorbs grease — that means it is working.
