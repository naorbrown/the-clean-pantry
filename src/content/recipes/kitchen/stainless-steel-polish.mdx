## Steps

1. Dampen the first microfiber cloth with 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
2. Wipe the stainless steel surface in the direction of the grain to remove fingerprints and grime.
3. Let the vinegar dry for about 30 seconds.
4. Place a few drops of olive oil (about 1 teaspoon) onto the second dry microfiber cloth.
5. Rub the oiled cloth over the surface, again following the direction of the grain. Use long, even strokes.
6. Continue buffing with the dry side of the cloth until no oily residue remains and the surface has an even sheen.

## Why It Works

Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits, water spots, and fingerprint oils. Olive oil fills microscopic grooves in the brushed finish, creating a thin layer that reflects light evenly. The oil also makes the surface hydrophobic, so fingerprints and water spots take longer to form.

## Alternative

- Substitute coconut oil (in its liquid state) for olive oil. Coconut oil is slightly lighter and less likely to leave a tacky feel in humid climates.
- For a combined cleaner-polish, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon vinegar in a small spray bottle. Shake before each use, spray onto the surface, and buff with a microfiber cloth.
- Club soda (carbonated water) can replace vinegar for a gentler clean on lightly soiled surfaces.

## Tips

- Use only a tiny amount of oil. Excess attracts dust and feels greasy.
- Do not use on stainless steel cookware interiors that contact food.
- Microfiber cloths are essential — paper towels leave lint and can cause fine scratches.
