## Steps

1. Dampen the first microfiber cloth with 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
2. Wipe the stainless steel surface in the direction of the grain to remove fingerprints, smudges, and surface grime. The grain is the faint directional lines visible on the metal.
3. Let the vinegar dry for about 30 seconds.
4. Place a few drops of olive oil (about 1 teaspoon) onto the second dry microfiber cloth.
5. Rub the oiled cloth over the surface, again following the direction of the grain. Use long, even strokes.
6. Continue buffing with the dry side of the cloth until no oily residue remains and the surface has an even sheen.

## Why It Works

Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves mineral deposits, water spots, and the oils from fingerprints that dull stainless steel surfaces. Once the surface is clean, olive oil fills in the microscopic grooves in the steel's brushed finish, creating a thin protective layer that reflects light evenly. This is the same principle commercial stainless steel polishes use, except they rely on silicone oils. The oil layer also makes the surface slightly hydrophobic, which means fingerprints and water spots take longer to form after polishing.

## Alternative

- Substitute coconut oil (in its liquid state) for olive oil. Coconut oil is slightly lighter and less likely to leave a tacky feel in humid climates.
- For a combined cleaner-polish, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon vinegar in a small spray bottle. Shake before each use, spray onto the surface, and buff with a microfiber cloth.
- Club soda (carbonated water) can replace vinegar for a gentler clean on lightly soiled surfaces.

## Tips

- Always wipe with the grain, never against it or in circles. Circular motions create visible swirl marks on brushed stainless steel.
- Use only a tiny amount of oil. Excess oil attracts dust and makes the surface feel greasy. If you over-apply, wipe off the excess with a clean dry cloth.
- This method works on refrigerators, dishwasher fronts, range hoods, and stainless sinks. Do not use it on stainless steel cookware interiors that contact food.
- Microfiber cloths are essential. Paper towels and regular cotton cloths leave lint and can cause fine scratches.
