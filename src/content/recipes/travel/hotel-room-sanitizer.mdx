## Steps

1. Pour 1 oz white vinegar into a 2 oz travel spray bottle.
2. Add 1 oz distilled water.
3. Add 5 drops tea tree essential oil.
4. Shake well for 10 seconds.
5. Spray high-touch surfaces: nightstands, remotes, light switches, door handles, bathroom fixtures.
6. Let sit 30 seconds, then wipe with a tissue or cloth.

## Why It Works

Tea tree's terpinen-4-ol disrupts bacterial and fungal cell membranes. Vinegar's acetic acid dissolves grime and disrupts bacterial membranes through a separate mechanism. Together they clean and sanitize in one step.

## Alternative

Replace tea tree with 5 drops eucalyptus oil for similar antimicrobial effect with a milder scent.

## Tips

- Label the bottle for TSA — "surface spray" on a piece of tape avoids questions.
- Shake before each use. Oil separates from the vinegar-water mix.
- Wipe remotes and light switches first — they harbor more bacteria than toilet seats in many hotel rooms.
- Also works on airplane tray tables, rental car steering wheels, and Airbnb door handles.
