## Steps

1. Measure 1 tablespoon of baking soda into each of the four muslin bags.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of cedar chips to each bag, layering them on top of the baking soda.
3. Drop 1–2 drops of tea tree essential oil into each bag, aiming for the baking soda layer so it absorbs the oil.
4. Pull the drawstrings tight and tie a secure knot. The bags will be stuffed into shoes, so they need to stay closed.
5. Squeeze each pouch gently to distribute the ingredients and release the initial scent.
6. Insert one pouch into each shoe, pushing it toward the toe area where odor concentrates most.
7. Place the shoes in your suitcase or leave them by the door overnight. The pouches work best with at least 6–8 hours of contact time.

## Why It Works

Cedar (Juniperus virginiana) contains cedrol and thujopsene, compounds with natural antimicrobial and antifungal properties that target the bacteria responsible for foot odor. The primary odor-causing culprit in shoes is Brevibacterium linens — the same bacterium responsible for the smell of certain strong cheeses — and cedar's volatile compounds disrupt its growth cycle. Baking soda absorbs moisture and neutralizes the isovaleric acid that gives shoes their characteristic sour smell. Isovaleric acid is produced when skin bacteria break down the amino acid leucine in sweat, and baking soda's alkaline pH converts it into odorless sodium isovalerate. Tea tree oil adds a third line of defense with its terpinen-4-ol content, which has broad antifungal activity — particularly useful for preventing the conditions that lead to athlete's foot in warm, damp travel shoes. Together, these three ingredients eliminate odor at its source rather than masking it with fragrance.

## Alternative

No cedar chips? Use activated charcoal (1 tablespoon per pouch) instead — it adsorbs odor molecules through its massive surface area. One gram of activated charcoal has roughly 3,000 square meters of surface area, giving it extraordinary capacity to trap volatile odor compounds. Skip the tea tree oil if using charcoal, since the charcoal will adsorb the essential oil before it can do its antimicrobial work. The charcoal version is scentless, which some travelers prefer.

## Tips

- Insert one pouch per shoe before packing them in your suitcase. Leave overnight for best results — the pouches need several hours to fully absorb moisture and neutralize odor compounds.
- Refresh every 3–4 weeks by microwaving the pouches for 30 seconds (this drives off absorbed moisture and odor compounds from the baking soda) and adding fresh drops of tea tree oil.
- Pet-store cedar bedding is the cheapest source of cedar chips. One small bag will make dozens of pouches. Look for untreated, unscented cedar — some pet bedding adds artificial fragrances you do not need.
- These pouches also work in gym bags, ski boots, rain boots, and hiking shoes. Any enclosed space where shoes sit idle benefits from a deodorizer pouch.
- For extra-stubborn shoe odor, double up — use two pouches per shoe and leave them in for 24 hours before your trip.
