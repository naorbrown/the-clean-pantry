## Steps

1. Add 1 tablespoon baking soda to each of the four muslin bags.
2. Add 1 tablespoon cedar chips to each bag.
3. Drop 1-2 drops tea tree essential oil into each bag, targeting the baking soda layer.
4. Tie drawstrings tight and knot securely.
5. Squeeze each pouch to distribute ingredients.
6. Insert one pouch per shoe, pushing toward the toe.
7. Leave in shoes at least 6-8 hours or overnight for best results.

## Why It Works

Cedar's cedrol and thujopsene have antimicrobial and antifungal properties targeting odor-causing bacteria. Baking soda absorbs moisture and neutralizes isovaleric acid (the sour smell from sweat breakdown). Tea tree's terpinen-4-ol adds antifungal defense against athlete's foot conditions.

## Alternative

Substitute activated charcoal (1 tablespoon per pouch) for cedar chips. Skip the tea tree oil with charcoal — the charcoal adsorbs the oil before it can work. The charcoal version is scentless.

## Tips

- Refresh every 3-4 weeks: microwave pouches 30 seconds to drive off absorbed moisture, then add fresh tea tree oil.
- Pet-store cedar bedding is the cheapest source. Look for untreated, unscented cedar.
- Also works in gym bags, ski boots, rain boots, and hiking shoes.
- For stubborn odor, double up — two pouches per shoe for 24 hours.
