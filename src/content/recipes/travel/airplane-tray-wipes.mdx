## Steps

1. Cut flannel into ten 6×6 inch squares. Pinking shears prevent fraying.
2. Combine 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup rubbing alcohol, and 1/4 cup distilled water.
3. Add 5 drops lavender essential oil and stir.
4. Stack the squares in an airtight container or ziplock bag.
5. Pour the solution evenly over the stack, pressing down so each square absorbs liquid.
6. Seal tightly, pressing out excess air.
7. Let sit at least 5 minutes before using.
8. Wipe down tray table, armrests, seatbelt buckle, and air vent knob.
9. Let surfaces air-dry 15-20 seconds.
10. Store used wipes in a separate bag to wash later.

## Why It Works

70% isopropyl alcohol is more effective than higher concentrations because the water content slows evaporation, giving more contact time to denature microbial proteins. Vinegar cuts through sticky food residue on tray tables. Flannel holds liquid better than cotton or paper and releases it evenly.

## Alternative

Replace vinegar with more rubbing alcohol (1/2 cup total with 1/4 cup water) for faster-drying wipes. Less cleaning power on sticky residue, but strong sanitizing effect.

## Tips

- TSA allows pre-soaked wipes without counting them as liquids.
- Pack 3-4 wipes per flight. Keep the rest for the return trip.
- Machine wash flannel squares in hot water to reuse.
- Skip the essential oil if you are scent-sensitive in close quarters.
