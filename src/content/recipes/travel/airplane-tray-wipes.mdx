## Steps

1. Cut flannel fabric into ten 6×6 inch squares if not already pre-cut. Pinking shears help prevent fraying at the edges.
2. Combine 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup rubbing alcohol, and 1/4 cup distilled water in a small bowl.
3. Add 5 drops of lavender essential oil to the mixture and stir well.
4. Stack the flannel squares in a small airtight container or ziplock bag.
5. Pour the cleaning solution evenly over the stacked squares, pressing down so each one absorbs the liquid.
6. Seal the container or bag tightly, pressing out excess air.
7. Let the wipes sit for at least 5 minutes before using so the solution distributes evenly through all layers.
8. To use, pull one wipe from the stack and wipe down your tray table, armrests, seatbelt buckle, and air vent knob.
9. Allow surfaces to air-dry for 15–20 seconds after wiping.
10. Store used wipes in a separate ziplock bag to wash later.

## Why It Works

70% isopropyl alcohol is more effective as a surface disinfectant than higher concentrations because the water content slows evaporation, giving the alcohol more contact time to denature proteins in microorganisms. Pure (99%) alcohol evaporates so quickly that it does not have enough contact time to fully penetrate bacterial cell walls. The 70/30 ratio is the sweet spot recommended by microbiology research for surface disinfection. Vinegar adds cleaning power for sticky residues — food spills are common on tray tables, and acetic acid breaks down sugars and grease effectively. Together, the alcohol handles germ elimination while the vinegar tackles visible grime. Flannel holds liquid better than cotton or paper towels, releasing it evenly when wiped across a surface. Its soft texture also means it will not scratch plastic tray table surfaces or leather armrests.

## Alternative

Skip the lavender oil and replace the vinegar with more rubbing alcohol (use 1/2 cup rubbing alcohol and 1/4 cup distilled water total) for a faster-drying wipe that works well on armrests and buckles. This version evaporates more quickly and leaves no scent, which some travelers prefer in the close quarters of an airplane cabin. The trade-off is slightly less cleaning power on sticky residues, but the sanitizing effect remains strong.

## Tips

- Store in a ziplock bag — TSA allows pre-soaked wipes without counting them as liquids, so you can bring these in your carry-on without using up your quart-bag allowance.
- Pack 3–4 wipes per flight and keep the rest in your checked luggage or hotel room for the return trip.
- Machine wash flannel squares in hot water to reuse — they last 30+ washes before the fibers start to thin out and lose absorbency.
- Wipe tray table, armrests, seatbelt buckle, and air vent knob before settling in. These are the four surfaces your hands will touch most during the flight.
- If you are sensitive to lavender, skip the essential oil entirely. The alcohol and vinegar work well on their own without any added scent.
