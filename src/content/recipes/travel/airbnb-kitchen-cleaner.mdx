## Steps

1. Add 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid castile soap to a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Fill the bottle with 1 cup of distilled water, pouring slowly to avoid creating excess foam.
3. Add 8 drops of lemon essential oil.
4. Screw on the spray nozzle and turn the bottle upside down gently a few times to mix. Avoid shaking vigorously — castile soap foams aggressively when agitated.
5. Spray onto countertops, sinks, stovetops, or appliance exteriors.
6. Wipe with a damp cloth or paper towel, working in circular motions to lift grime.
7. For food-contact surfaces like cutting boards or counters where you will prepare food, follow up with a rinse of plain water.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant — typically made from olive, coconut, or hemp oil — that lifts grease and grime without synthetic chemicals. Surfactants work by reducing the surface tension of water, allowing it to spread and penetrate into oily residues that water alone would bead off of. This makes castile soap safe for any food-contact surface while still being effective against kitchen grease, dried-on splatters, and general grime. Lemon essential oil contains d-limonene, a natural solvent that cuts through grease and leaves a clean citrus scent. D-limonene is so effective at dissolving oils that it is used industrially as a degreaser. In this formulation, it provides both cleaning power and a fresh aroma that makes unfamiliar rental kitchens feel more like your own. The 8 oz size fits easily in a checked bag or car trip supplies without taking up much luggage space.

## Alternative

No essential oil? Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar instead for cutting power — but never combine vinegar with castile soap in the same bottle. Vinegar's acid and castile soap's alkaline base neutralize each other, leaving you with a greasy, ineffective residue. Instead, mix them separately: use the castile soap spray for cleaning, then follow up with a vinegar-and-water spritz as a rinse. This two-step approach actually gives you a more thorough clean than either one alone.

## Tips

- Pack an empty spray bottle and a small bottle of castile soap concentrate — mix at your destination using tap water to save luggage space. A 2 oz bottle of concentrate makes roughly 16 spray bottles of cleaner.
- This spray works on countertops, stovetops, sinks, fridge shelves, and microwave interiors. It handles the full range of rental kitchen surfaces.
- Rinse food-contact surfaces with plain water after cleaning. Castile soap is non-toxic, but a quick rinse removes any soapy residue that could affect the taste of food.
- Do not use on marble, granite, or natural stone surfaces. The lemon oil's acidity can etch and dull stone over time. If the rental has stone counters, use the spray only on the sink, stovetop, and appliances.
- This recipe also works as a quick bathroom cleaner for sinks and countertops in rental accommodations.
