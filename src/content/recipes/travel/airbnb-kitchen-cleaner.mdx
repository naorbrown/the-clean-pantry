## Steps

1. Add 1 tablespoon unscented castile soap to a clean 8 oz spray bottle.
2. Fill with 1 cup distilled water, pouring slowly to minimize foam.
3. Add 8 drops of lemon essential oil.
4. Turn the bottle upside down gently a few times to mix. Do not shake hard.
5. Spray onto countertops, sinks, stovetops, or appliance exteriors.
6. Wipe with a damp cloth in circular motions.
7. Rinse food-contact surfaces with plain water.

## Why It Works

Castile soap is a plant-based surfactant that lifts grease and grime by reducing water's surface tension. Lemon oil's d-limonene is a natural solvent that cuts through grease and leaves a fresh scent.

## Alternative

No essential oil? Use 1 tablespoon white vinegar instead — but never combine vinegar with castile soap in the same bottle. Their acid and base neutralize each other. Use them as separate steps: soap spray first, vinegar spritz as a rinse.

## Tips

- Pack an empty spray bottle and 2 oz castile soap concentrate. Mix at your destination to save luggage space.
- Do not use on marble, granite, or natural stone. The lemon oil's acidity can etch stone.
- Also works as a quick bathroom cleaner for rental sinks and countertops.
