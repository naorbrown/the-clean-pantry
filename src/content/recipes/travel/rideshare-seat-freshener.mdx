## Steps

1. Measure 1 tablespoon of baking soda into each of the two muslin bags.
2. Add half a tablespoon of dried lavender buds to each bag, distributing them on top of the baking soda.
3. Drop 1–2 drops of peppermint essential oil onto the baking soda in each bag. The baking soda absorbs the oil and releases it slowly over time.
4. Pull the drawstrings closed and tie a knot to keep the contents secure.
5. Gently squeeze each sachet a few times to mix the ingredients together inside the bag.
6. Tuck one sachet into your bag, jacket pocket, or purse before heading out. Keep the second as a backup or give it to a travel companion.

## Why It Works

Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) neutralizes odors through acid-base chemistry — it reacts with volatile organic acids that cause most unpleasant smells, converting them to odorless sodium salts. This is actual chemical neutralization, not just masking. The most common odor-causing compounds in vehicles (sweat, food residue, stale air) are acidic in nature, making baking soda particularly effective in this setting. Dried lavender releases linalool and linalyl acetate, compounds with documented calming and antimicrobial properties. These compounds volatilize slowly at room temperature, providing a steady release of pleasant scent over several weeks. The combination of peppermint's menthol and lavender's linalool creates a scent profile that is fresh without being overpowering — important when you are sitting close to a driver in a small vehicle. The sachet form means zero spraying in someone else's vehicle, which avoids any awkwardness and respects the driver's space and property.

## Alternative

Replace lavender with dried rosemary or dried mint from your kitchen spice rack for a different scent profile. Rosemary contains camphor and 1,8-cineole, which provide a more herbaceous, invigorating aroma. Dried mint doubles down on the cooling menthol character. Cedar chips also work well in place of lavender and add a natural insect-repellent benefit — the cedrol they release is a proven moth and mosquito deterrent, which can be a bonus in tropical travel destinations.

## Tips

- Tuck one sachet in your bag or jacket pocket before getting into a rideshare. Hold it near your face or set it on your lap for personal air freshening without spraying anything into the vehicle.
- Each sachet lasts 2–3 weeks of regular use. Refresh by opening the drawstring and adding 2 more drops of peppermint essential oil directly onto the baking soda inside.
- Great for long bus or train rides too — the no-liquid format means no spill risk and no restrictions from transit authorities.
- These sachets also work well tucked into a hotel room nightstand drawer or placed on a bathroom counter to freshen a stuffy rental.
- When the scent fades completely after a few weeks, the baking soda inside still works as a deodorizer. Sprinkle it into your shoes or trash can before discarding the muslin bag.
