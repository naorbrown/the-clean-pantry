## Steps

1. Add 1 tablespoon baking soda to each muslin bag.
2. Add half a tablespoon dried lavender buds to each.
3. Drop 1-2 drops peppermint essential oil onto the baking soda in each bag.
4. Pull drawstrings closed and tie a knot.
5. Squeeze each sachet a few times to mix the contents.
6. Tuck one in your bag or pocket before heading out. Keep the second as a backup.

## Why It Works

Baking soda chemically neutralizes volatile organic acids that cause odors — actual neutralization, not masking. Lavender releases linalool steadily at room temperature. The sachet format means zero spraying in someone else's vehicle.

## Alternative

Replace lavender with dried rosemary or mint for a different scent. Cedar chips work well and add a natural insect-repellent benefit.

## Tips

- Hold near your face or set on your lap for personal air freshening in a rideshare.
- Refresh after 2-3 weeks by adding 2 more drops of peppermint oil.
- Great for long bus or train rides — no liquid, no spill risk, no transit restrictions.
- When the scent fades, sprinkle the baking soda into shoes before discarding the bag.
