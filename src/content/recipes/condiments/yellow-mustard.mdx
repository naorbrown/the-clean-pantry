## Steps

1. Combine the mustard powder, turmeric, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk the dry ingredients together to break up any clumps in the mustard powder.
2. Add the water and white vinegar to the dry mixture. Stir vigorously with a whisk or fork until you get a smooth, uniform paste with no lumps.
3. Transfer the mustard to a small saucepan and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. The heat activates the mustard's flavor compounds and thickens the mixture to a spreadable consistency.
4. Remove from heat. Stir in the honey if using — it rounds off the sharp bite of raw mustard and adds a subtle sweetness.
5. Let cool completely. The mustard will thicken further as it sits. Transfer to a clean glass jar and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before using — this resting period allows the harsh, bitter compounds to mellow into the familiar tangy flavor.

## Why It Works

Ground mustard seeds contain two precursor compounds — sinigrin and myrosin — that only produce the characteristic pungent heat when mixed with liquid. The enzyme myrosinase converts sinigrin into allyl isothiocyanate, the molecule responsible for mustard's bite. Vinegar (an acid) slows this enzymatic reaction, which is why prepared mustard has a stable, mild heat rather than the explosive burn of freshly ground mustard mixed with water alone. Turmeric contributes the classic bright yellow color that distinguishes American-style mustard from its European counterparts.

## Tips

- **Resting is essential.** Fresh mustard tastes aggressively bitter and sharp. After 24-48 hours in the fridge, the flavor transforms into the mellow tang you expect. Do not judge the final product on day one.
- **Consistency control.** For thinner mustard (squeeze-bottle style), add an extra tablespoon of water. For thicker mustard (stone-ground style), reduce the water by 2 tablespoons.
- **Shelf life.** Refrigerated in a sealed jar, homemade mustard keeps for 2-3 months. The vinegar prevents bacterial growth.
