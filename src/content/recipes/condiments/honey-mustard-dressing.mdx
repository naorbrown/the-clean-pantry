## Steps

1. Combine the dijon mustard and honey in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously until they form a uniform, smooth paste — the mustard and honey should be fully integrated with no visible streaks.
2. Add the apple cider vinegar and salt. Whisk to combine. The mixture will thin slightly as the vinegar blends in.
3. While whisking continuously, drizzle in the olive oil in a slow, thin stream. Adding the oil gradually allows the mustard to emulsify it, creating a smooth, creamy dressing rather than an oily, separated one.
4. Continue whisking until the dressing is thick and glossy. Taste and adjust: more honey for sweetness, more mustard for sharpness, more vinegar for brightness.
5. Transfer to a jar and refrigerate. The dressing thickens slightly when chilled and the flavors meld over the first hour.

## Why It Works

Dijon mustard is one of the best natural emulsifiers in the kitchen. Its ground mustard seeds contain mucilage, a polysaccharide that coats oil droplets and prevents them from separating from the water-based vinegar and honey. This is why the slow drizzle technique matters: adding oil gradually gives the mucilage time to coat each droplet before more oil is introduced. Honey serves a dual role — it sweetens the dressing while its fructose and glucose molecules increase the viscosity of the water phase, further stabilizing the emulsion. The apple cider vinegar contributes acidity that balances the sweetness and extends shelf life.

## Tips

- **Marinade use.** This dressing makes an excellent chicken or pork marinade. Coat the protein and refrigerate for 1-2 hours before grilling or baking. The acid in the vinegar and mustard tenderizes the meat.
- **Creamy version.** Add 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt or mayonnaise for a thicker, creamier dressing suited for heavy salads or as a sandwich spread.
- **Shelf life.** Keeps 2 weeks refrigerated. Shake or whisk well before each use as the emulsion can separate slightly over time.
- **Whole grain variation.** Swap the dijon mustard for whole grain mustard for a more rustic, textured dressing with visible mustard seeds.
