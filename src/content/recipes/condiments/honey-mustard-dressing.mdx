## Steps

1. Whisk the dijon mustard and honey in a small bowl until smooth with no visible streaks.
2. Add the apple cider vinegar and salt. Whisk to combine.
3. While whisking continuously, drizzle in the olive oil in a slow, thin stream.
4. Continue whisking until thick and glossy. Taste and adjust sweetness, sharpness, or brightness.
5. Transfer to a jar and refrigerate. Flavors meld over the first hour.

## Why It Works

Dijon mustard contains mucilage that coats oil droplets and prevents separation -- the slow drizzle gives it time to emulsify each addition. Honey sweetens while its sugars thicken the water phase, further stabilizing the emulsion. Apple cider vinegar balances sweetness and extends shelf life.

## Tips

- **Marinade use.** Coat chicken or pork and refrigerate 1-2 hours before grilling.
- **Creamy version.** Add 2 tablespoons of yogurt or mayo for a thicker dressing or sandwich spread.
- **Shelf life.** Keeps 2 weeks refrigerated. Whisk before each use.
- **Whole grain variation.** Swap dijon for whole grain mustard for a rustier, textured dressing.
