## Steps

1. Wash the peppers and remove the stems. Cut them in half lengthwise — no need to remove seeds unless you want a milder sauce. Wear gloves while handling hot peppers to avoid capsaicin burns.
2. Pack the peppers and peeled garlic cloves into a clean glass jar (a quart mason jar works well). Press them down firmly so they are tightly packed.
3. Dissolve the salt in the filtered water to create a brine. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved. Pour the brine over the peppers until they are fully submerged.
4. Keep the peppers submerged below the brine — use a fermentation weight, a small plate, or a zip-lock bag filled with water pressed on top. Any peppers exposed to air can develop mold.
5. Cover the jar loosely with a lid (do not seal tightly — fermentation produces carbon dioxide that needs to escape). Place the jar in a cool, dark spot at room temperature.
6. Ferment for 5-7 days, checking daily. You should see bubbles forming within 2-3 days — this means the beneficial lactobacillus bacteria are active. Press down any peppers that float above the brine.
7. After 5-7 days (or when bubbling slows), strain the brine and reserve it. Transfer the peppers and garlic to a blender. Add the white vinegar and enough reserved brine to reach your desired consistency. Blend until smooth.
8. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve for a smooth hot sauce, or leave as-is for a chunkier texture. Bottle in clean glass containers and refrigerate.

## Why It Works

Lacto-fermentation creates hot sauce with a depth of flavor that vinegar-only sauces cannot match. The salt brine creates a selective environment where lactobacillus bacteria thrive but harmful bacteria cannot survive. As lactobacillus consumes sugars in the peppers, it produces lactic acid — the same compound that gives yogurt and sauerkraut their characteristic tangy flavor. This lactic acid lowers the pH to around 3.5, naturally preserving the sauce without cooking. The fermentation process also breaks down the pepper cell walls, releasing more capsaicin and flavor compounds than blending raw peppers alone.

## Tips

- **Pepper selection.** Mix pepper varieties for complex flavor: habaneros for fruity heat, serranos for grassy brightness, cayenne for straightforward spice. Using a single variety makes a more one-dimensional sauce.
- **Fermentation length.** Longer fermentation (up to 2 weeks) produces a more complex, tangier sauce with less raw pepper bite. Shorter fermentation (3-4 days) preserves more of the fresh pepper flavor.
- **Shelf life.** The combination of low pH and refrigeration keeps fermented hot sauce good for 6 months or longer. The flavor continues to develop slowly over time.
- **Mold troubleshooting.** White film (kahm yeast) on the surface is harmless — skim it off and continue. Black, green, or fuzzy mold means the batch should be discarded.
