## Steps

1. Combine the tomato paste and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until the paste dissolves into a smooth, pourable liquid with no lumps.
2. Add the apple cider vinegar, molasses, brown sugar, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Stir thoroughly to combine all ingredients.
3. Bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, stirring every few minutes to prevent the sugars from scorching on the bottom of the pan.
4. The sauce is ready when it coats the back of a spoon and slowly drips off. It will thicken further as it cools, so pull it off the heat while it is still slightly thinner than your target consistency.
5. Taste and adjust: more brown sugar for sweetness, more vinegar for tang, more smoked paprika for smokiness. The flavors balance and meld after cooling.
6. Let cool to room temperature. Transfer to a clean glass jar and refrigerate.

## Why It Works

Barbecue sauce is fundamentally a balance of sweet, sour, and smoky. Molasses provides deep, mineral-rich sweetness plus color — it contains iron, calcium, and potassium that give it a complexity refined sugar cannot match. Brown sugar adds a lighter, caramel sweetness that rounds out the molasses. Apple cider vinegar cuts through the sweetness with its acetic acid while contributing fruity undertones. Smoked paprika delivers smokiness without requiring actual fire — the peppers used to make it are dried over smoldering oak, infusing the spice with guaiacol and syringol, the same smoke flavor compounds produced by wood-fired grills.

## Tips

- **Spice it up.** Add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper or a few dashes of your homemade hot sauce for a BBQ sauce with kick.
- **Thicker sauce.** For a thicker, stickier glaze-style sauce, reduce the water to 1/4 cup and simmer for an extra 10 minutes.
- **Shelf life.** Stored in a sealed jar in the fridge, homemade BBQ sauce keeps for 3-4 weeks. The vinegar and sugar act as natural preservatives.
- **Grilling tip.** Apply BBQ sauce only during the last 5 minutes of grilling. The sugars will burn if applied too early, turning bitter instead of caramelized.
