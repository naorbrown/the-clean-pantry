## Steps

1. Combine the tomato paste and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until smooth and pourable.
2. Add the apple cider vinegar, molasses, brown sugar, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Stir to combine.
3. Bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, stirring every few minutes to prevent scorching.
4. Pull off heat when the sauce coats a spoon and slowly drips off -- it thickens further as it cools.
5. Taste and adjust: more sugar for sweetness, vinegar for tang, paprika for smokiness.
6. Cool to room temperature. Transfer to a clean glass jar and refrigerate.

## Why It Works

Molasses provides mineral-rich sweetness that refined sugar cannot match. Brown sugar rounds it out with lighter caramel notes. Apple cider vinegar cuts the sweetness with fruity acidity. Smoked paprika delivers smokiness without fire -- the peppers are dried over smoldering oak.

## Tips

- **Spice it up.** Add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne or a few dashes of hot sauce.
- **Thicker sauce.** Reduce water to 1/4 cup and simmer an extra 10 minutes.
- **Shelf life.** Keeps 3-4 weeks refrigerated in a sealed jar.
- **Grilling tip.** Apply only during the last 5 minutes -- sugars burn and turn bitter if applied too early.
