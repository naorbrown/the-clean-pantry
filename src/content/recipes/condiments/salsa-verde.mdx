## Steps

1. Set the oven to broil on high. Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup.
2. Place the tomatillos, jalapeno, onion quarters, and unpeeled garlic cloves on the baking sheet. Arrange them in a single layer with space between each piece so they roast rather than steam.
3. Broil for 5-7 minutes until the tops are charred and blistered — dark brown spots are good. Flip each piece and broil another 5-7 minutes until the second side is charred. The tomatillos should be soft and releasing liquid.
4. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their papery skins — they should be soft and paste-like.
5. Transfer all roasted vegetables, including any liquid on the baking sheet, into a blender or food processor. Add the cilantro, lime juice, and salt.
6. Pulse 8-10 times for a chunky salsa, or blend for 30 seconds for a smoother consistency. Taste and adjust salt and lime juice as needed.
7. Let cool completely before transferring to a jar. The salsa thickens slightly and the flavors deepen as it chills.

## Why It Works

Roasting the tomatillos transforms them from tart and astringent raw fruits into sweet, smoky, and complex ingredients. The high heat of the broiler triggers caramelization of their natural sugars while charring the skin produces bitter compounds that balance the sweetness — this is why the dark spots are desirable, not a mistake. Tomatillos contain pectin, a natural thickener that activates when heated, giving roasted salsa verde its body without any added thickeners. Cilantro stems contain the same flavor compounds as the leaves but in higher concentration, which is why this recipe includes them. The lime juice provides a hit of citric acid that preserves the salsa's bright green color by slowing the oxidation of chlorophyll.

## Tips

- **Heat control.** For mild salsa, remove the jalapeno seeds and membrane before roasting. For maximum heat, leave the seeds in and add a second jalapeno.
- **Char is flavor.** Do not skip or rush the charring step. The Maillard reaction on the tomatillo skins creates dozens of new flavor compounds that give this salsa its distinctive smoky depth.
- **Shelf life.** Keeps 7-10 days refrigerated. The acidity from tomatillos and lime juice acts as a natural preservative. Can also be frozen in ice cube trays for up to 3 months.
- **Cilantro substitute.** For those with the gene that makes cilantro taste soapy, substitute an equal amount of flat-leaf parsley plus 1 teaspoon of ground cumin.
