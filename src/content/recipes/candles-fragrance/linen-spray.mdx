## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of vodka (any inexpensive unflavored vodka works) or alcohol-free witch hazel into an 8 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 20 drops of lavender essential oil and 10 drops of chamomile essential oil directly into the vodka or witch hazel. Swirl to combine. Adding the oils to the alcohol first helps them emulsify when you add the water.
3. Fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water (approximately 3/4 cup). Use distilled rather than tap water to prevent mineral deposits on fabric and to extend shelf life.
4. Screw on the spray top and shake well.
5. Hold the bottle 12-18 inches from the fabric and mist lightly over pillows, sheets, blankets, curtains, or upholstered furniture. Two to three spritzes per pillow is enough. You want a light mist, not a soaking.
6. Allow the fabric to air dry before use. The alcohol evaporates within minutes, leaving only the scent.

## Why It Works

Lavender essential oil contains linalool and linalyl acetate, two compounds that have been studied for their calming effects. When misted onto bedding, the scent is inhaled gently throughout the night at a low, steady concentration -- far more subtle than a diffuser running continuously. Chamomile adds a warm, slightly sweet note that complements lavender and has its own reputation as a calming botanical.

The vodka or witch hazel serves two purposes. First, it acts as a solvent that allows the essential oils to disperse in water instead of floating as droplets on the surface. Without it, you would get inconsistent sprays -- some bursts heavy with oil, others with none. Second, the alcohol acts as a mild preservative, preventing bacterial growth in the water. A properly made linen spray with an alcohol base lasts 2-3 months without spoiling.

## Tips

- **Glass bottles are best.** Essential oils, especially citrus ones, can break down plastic over time, leaching chemicals into the spray. If you must use plastic, choose PET (recycling code #1) or HDPE (#2).
- **Customize your scent.** This recipe is a template. Swap the lavender and chamomile for any combination you prefer. Good alternatives include: cedarwood and bergamot for a woodsy scent, ylang-ylang and sweet orange for a bright floral, or eucalyptus and peppermint for a fresh daytime spray.
- **Shake every time.** Oil and water separate between uses. A quick shake before each spray ensures even distribution.
- **Use on dryer balls.** Spray 3-4 spritzes onto wool dryer balls and toss them in the dryer with your sheets. The heat diffuses the scent throughout the laundry.
- **Not just for bedding.** This spray works well on couch cushions, car upholstery, closets, and stored linens. Spray a light mist inside dresser drawers to keep folded clothes fresh.

## Alternative

For a no-alcohol version, replace the vodka with 1 tablespoon of vegetable glycerin. Glycerin is a plant-based emulsifier that helps the oils disperse in water. The shelf life is shorter (about 1 month), so make smaller batches and store in the refrigerator.
