## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of vodka or witch hazel into an 8 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 20 drops lavender and 10 drops chamomile essential oil into the vodka/witch hazel. Swirl to combine.
3. Fill the rest with distilled water (about 3/4 cup).
4. Screw on the spray top and shake well.
5. Hold 12-18 inches from fabric and mist lightly — 2-3 spritzes per pillow.
6. Allow fabric to air dry before use.

## Why It Works

Lavender oil has calming properties and delivers a gentle, steady scent when misted onto bedding. Chamomile adds a warm, sweet note with its own calming reputation. The vodka or witch hazel serves as both an emulsifier (so oils disperse evenly in water) and a preservative (preventing bacterial growth). A properly made spray lasts 2-3 months.

## Alternative

For a no-alcohol version, replace the vodka with 1 tablespoon of vegetable glycerin. Glycerin is a plant-based emulsifier that helps the oils disperse in water. The shelf life is shorter (about 1 month), so make smaller batches and store in the refrigerator.
## Tips

- **Glass bottles are best.** Essential oils can break down plastic over time. If you must use plastic, choose PET (#1) or HDPE (#2).
- **Customize your scent.** Swap lavender and chamomile for cedarwood + bergamot (woodsy), ylang-ylang + sweet orange (bright floral), or eucalyptus + peppermint (fresh daytime).
- **Use on dryer balls.** Spray 3-4 spritzes onto wool dryer balls and toss in the dryer with sheets.
- **Not just for bedding.** Works on couch cushions, car upholstery, closets, and dresser drawers.
