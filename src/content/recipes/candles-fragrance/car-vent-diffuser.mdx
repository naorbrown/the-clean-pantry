## Steps

1. Cut 2 rectangles of thick wool felt, about 1.5 x 2 inches. Use wool, not polyester craft felt.
2. Place a felt pad on a paper towel and add 5-8 drops of essential oil. Let absorb for 1 minute.
3. Clip a wooden clothespin or binder clip onto a horizontal slat of your car's air vent.
4. Slide the oiled felt pad into the clothespin grip so it hangs in front of the vent opening.
5. Repeat with the second pad on a different vent, or save it as a replacement.
6. Turn on your ventilation fan. Scent is noticeable within 30 seconds.
7. Re-apply 3-5 drops every 3-5 days. The felt pad lasts months before needing replacement.

## Why It Works

Wool fibers have a porous core that absorbs and holds essential oils. Moving air from the vent strips volatile molecules from the felt surface through forced evaporation — far more effective than passive diffusion. Higher fan speeds produce stronger scent; lower speeds make the oil last longer, giving you natural intensity control.

## Tips

- **Choose alerting oils for driving.** Peppermint (menthol activates cold receptors, promoting wakefulness), lemon (limonene is associated with alertness), eucalyptus (1,8-cineole supports clear breathing), and rosemary (camphor aids focus) are all good choices. Avoid lavender, chamomile, and ylang-ylang in the car.
- **Make spare pads.** Cut 4-6 felt rectangles at once and keep them in a small ziplock bag in the glove box. When one pad gets too saturated with old oil residue, swap in a fresh one.
- **Wooden clothespins look better.** A plain wooden clothespin blends in with most car interiors. You can decorate them with washi tape or paint if you want something more personal.
- **Use the recirculation setting strategically.** When you first clip in a fresh pad, run the fan on recirculate for 5 minutes to fill the cabin quickly. Then switch to fresh air mode so the scent stays at a background level.
- **Avoid citrus oils near plastic.** If the felt pad contacts plastic vent slats, citrus oils (lemon, orange, grapefruit) can degrade the plastic over time. Position the pad so it hangs freely without touching the vent housing.
- **This beats commercial car fresheners** because you control the ingredients. Commercial hanging air fresheners contain synthetic fragrance compounds, phthalates, and formaldehyde-releasing agents.
