## Steps

1. Harvest or purchase fresh rosemary, lavender, and garden sage. The herbs must be fresh, not dried, because you need pliable stems that can be tightly bundled. Dried herbs crumble when wrapped.
2. Sort the herbs by length and trim all stems to approximately 6-8 inches. Remove any brown or wilted leaves. You want only healthy, green, aromatic material.
3. Build each bundle by layering 2-3 sprigs of rosemary, 2-3 stems of lavender, and 2-3 sage leaves on stems, alternating herbs so the scents are distributed throughout. Arrange them with the stem ends aligned at the bottom.
4. Cut a 4-foot length of cotton string for each bundle. Starting at the base (stem end), wrap the string tightly around the bundle, leaving a 6-inch tail.
5. Spiral the string upward toward the leafy end, wrapping at approximately 1/2-inch intervals. Pull the string snug with each wrap -- the bundle will shrink significantly as it dries, so tight wrapping prevents it from falling apart later.
6. When you reach the top, reverse direction and spiral back down to the base, creating a criss-cross pattern. Tie off the string at the base with a firm double knot.
7. Hang the bundles upside down (leafy end pointing down) in a warm, dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. A closet, pantry, or covered porch works well. Avoid humid rooms like kitchens and bathrooms.
8. Allow the bundles to dry for 5-7 days. They are ready when the leaves feel crisp and papery and the stems snap cleanly when bent. If any part still feels flexible or moist, give them more time. Under-dried bundles will not stay lit.
9. To use, hold the leafy end of the bundle at a 45-degree angle and light it with a match or lighter. Let it flame for 10-15 seconds, then blow out the flame. The bundle should smolder and produce a steady stream of aromatic smoke. If it goes out, relight the tip.

## Why It Works

Fresh herbs contain volatile aromatic oils stored in trichomes (tiny glandular structures on the leaf surface) and within the plant's cellular structure. When the herbs are dried slowly, the water evaporates but the oil-containing trichomes remain intact, creating a concentrated reservoir of aromatic compounds. Rosemary contains camphor, 1,8-cineole, and alpha-pinene. Lavender contains linalool and linalyl acetate. Garden sage contains thujone and camphor. When the dried bundle smolders, the heat volatilizes these compounds in sequence based on their individual boiling points, creating a complex, evolving fragrance. The tight cotton wrapping controls airflow to the burning herbs, ensuring a slow smolder rather than an open flame. This lower-temperature combustion preserves more of the aromatic character than burning would.

## Tips

- Use garden sage (Salvia officinalis), the same sage you cook with. White sage (Salvia apiana) is overharvested from wild populations in the American Southwest and has deep cultural significance to Indigenous communities. Garden sage produces a beautiful, herby smoke with its own distinct character.
- Add a few sprigs of dried thyme, oregano, or juniper tips for variation. Juniper produces a particularly clean, piney smoke.
- The bundles shrink by about 30-40% as they dry. Wrap them tighter than you think is necessary. A loose bundle will fall apart when you try to burn it.
- If your bundle keeps going out, it was either not dried long enough or wrapped too tightly, restricting airflow. Try loosening the string slightly or drying for a few more days.
- Store finished bundles in a paper bag or cloth pouch -- not plastic. Plastic traps residual moisture and can cause mold.
- These make excellent gifts, especially tied with a ribbon and paired with a ceramic dish for catching ash.
