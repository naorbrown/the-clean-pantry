## Steps

1. Unplug the warmer and let it cool completely. For a solid wax disc, turn the warmer on for 2-3 minutes to soften, then slide the disc out.
2. Wipe out remaining soft wax with a dry paper towel.
3. Apply 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to the inside of the dish. Spread evenly over wax-stained areas.
4. Let sit for 3-5 minutes to dissolve the residue.
5. Wipe out the dissolved wax and coconut oil with fresh paper towels.
6. Mix 1 tablespoon baking soda with 2 tablespoons white vinegar. Scrub any remaining residue with a cotton ball.
7. Wipe clean with a damp paper towel and dry thoroughly.
8. If film remains, repeat the coconut oil step.

## Why It Works

Wax is nonpolar and does not dissolve in water, but coconut oil is also nonpolar — so it penetrates and breaks down wax far more effectively than soap. Baking soda is a mild abrasive that lifts dye stains without scratching ceramic or glass. Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and cuts through oily film. The two-stage approach (oil for wax, then abrasive for stains) handles both components of the residue.

## Tips

- Never pour melted wax down the drain — it solidifies in pipes. Wipe into the trash.
- Any cooking oil works, but coconut oil solidifies at room temperature, making cleanup neater.
- For heavy staining from colored wax, let coconut oil sit 15 minutes instead of 5.
- Clean between every scent change to avoid muddled fragrance profiles.
