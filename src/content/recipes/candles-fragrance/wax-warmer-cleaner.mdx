## Steps

1. Unplug the wax warmer and let it cool completely. If there is a solid disc of old wax in the dish, turn the warmer on for 2-3 minutes to soften the bottom layer, then slide the wax disc out in one piece.
2. Wipe out any remaining soft wax residue with a dry paper towel. Get as much wax out as possible before applying any cleaner.
3. Apply 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to the inside of the wax dish. Spread it evenly with a paper towel, covering all wax-stained areas.
4. Let the coconut oil sit for 3-5 minutes. It dissolves the remaining wax residue through the "like dissolves like" principle.
5. Wipe out the dissolved wax and coconut oil with fresh paper towels.
6. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to form a paste. Apply this to the dish with a cotton ball and gently scrub any remaining residue or discoloration.
7. Wipe the dish clean with a damp paper towel and dry thoroughly.
8. Inspect the dish for any remaining film. If present, repeat the coconut oil step once more.

## Why It Works

Wax is a nonpolar substance, meaning it does not dissolve in water. Coconut oil is also nonpolar, and the chemistry principle "like dissolves like" (similia similibus solventur) means nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes. The coconut oil penetrates and breaks down the wax residue far more effectively than soap and water ever could. The baking soda and vinegar paste serves a different purpose -- it addresses the dye stains and fragrance residue that the wax leaves behind. Baking soda is a mild abrasive that physically lifts stains without scratching ceramic or glass, while the vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and cuts through any remaining oily film. This two-stage approach (oil for wax, then alkaline abrasive for stains) handles both components of the residue.

## Tips

- Do not pour melted wax down the drain. It solidifies in pipes and causes clogs. Always wipe wax into the trash.
- If you do not have coconut oil, any cooking oil (olive, vegetable, canola) works the same way. Coconut oil is preferred because it solidifies at room temperature, making cleanup neater.
- For heavily stained warmers with buildup from colored wax melts, let the coconut oil sit for 15 minutes instead of 5.
- Clean your warmer between every scent change. Mixing old and new fragrances creates muddled, unpleasant scent profiles.
- Cotton balls work better than paper towels for the scrubbing step because they conform to the curved shape of the dish.
