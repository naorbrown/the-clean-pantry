## Steps

1. Place 1/2 cup of uncooked rice in a small bowl. Add 20 drops of essential oil and stir with a fork until the rice grains are evenly coated.
2. Let the scented rice sit for 5 minutes so the oil is absorbed into the grain surface.
3. Add the dried lavender buds and rosemary (if using) to the rice and toss gently to combine.
4. Divide the mixture evenly among the 4 muslin bags or fabric squares, about 2-3 tablespoons per sachet.
5. Tie each sachet closed with ribbon or twine. If using fabric squares, gather the corners and tie into a bundle.
6. Tuck one sachet into each drawer, placing it near the back where it will not interfere with clothing.
7. Squeeze the sachets gently every few days to refresh the scent by releasing more oil from the rice.
8. Add 5 fresh drops of essential oil to each sachet every 3-4 weeks to maintain fragrance strength.

## Why It Works

Rice is an excellent essential oil carrier — its porous starch surface absorbs oil and releases it slowly over weeks. Dried lavender buds contain their own volatile oils that continue releasing fragrance for months. In an enclosed drawer, the fragrance reaches a steady concentration and refreshes each time the drawer opens. Cedarwood oil doubles as a natural moth deterrent, making these sachets practical for woolens storage.

## Tips

- Use long-grain white rice, not instant or quick-cook varieties. Intact starch absorbs oil better.
- For moth repellence, use cedarwood oil and add a tablespoon of dried cedar shavings per sachet.
- Do not place sachets directly against silk or satin — the oils can leave marks. Place them on the drawer bottom instead.
- Lavender sachets under your pillow or in a nightstand drawer can promote better sleep.
