## Steps

1. Place 1/2 cup of uncooked rice in a small bowl. Add 20 drops of essential oil and stir with a fork until the rice grains are evenly coated.
2. Let the scented rice sit for 5 minutes so the oil is absorbed into the grain surface.
3. Add the dried lavender buds and rosemary (if using) to the rice and toss gently to combine.
4. Divide the mixture evenly among the 4 muslin bags or fabric squares, about 2-3 tablespoons per sachet.
5. Tie each sachet closed with ribbon or twine. If using fabric squares, gather the corners and tie into a bundle.
6. Tuck one sachet into each drawer, placing it near the back where it will not interfere with clothing.
7. Squeeze the sachets gently every few days to refresh the scent by releasing more oil from the rice.
8. Add 5 fresh drops of essential oil to each sachet every 3-4 weeks to maintain fragrance strength.

## Why It Works

Rice is an excellent essential oil carrier because its porous starch surface absorbs and slowly releases volatile oil molecules over weeks. The starch granules trap the oil in their surface crevices, creating a slow-release reservoir. Dried lavender buds contain their own natural volatile oils (linalool and linalyl acetate), which continue to release fragrance for months as the dried plant material slowly breaks down. In the enclosed environment of a drawer, the fragrance compounds reach equilibrium quickly -- the sachet releases molecules into the air until the concentration stabilizes, then continues releasing at a steady rate as the air is disturbed when the drawer is opened and closed. Cedarwood oil adds cedrol, which is not only fragrant but is a natural moth deterrent, making these sachets practical for woolens storage.

## Tips

- Use long-grain white rice, not instant or quick-cook varieties. The intact starch layer on unprocessed rice absorbs and holds oil better.
- For a moth-repellent version, use cedarwood oil and add a tablespoon of dried cedar shavings to each sachet.
- These make excellent gifts. Package in decorative fabric with a ribbon and include a small vial of essential oil for refreshing.
- Do not place sachets directly against silk or satin items. The oils can leave marks on delicate fabrics. Place them on the drawer bottom instead.
- Lavender sachets placed under your pillow or in a nightstand drawer can promote better sleep through aromatherapy.
