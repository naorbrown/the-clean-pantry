## Steps

1. **Set up a double boiler.** Fill a medium saucepan with 2-3 inches of water and place a heat-safe glass or metal pouring pitcher inside it. The pitcher should sit in the water without floating. Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.
2. **Melt the beeswax.** Add 8 oz of beeswax pellets to the pouring pitcher. Stir occasionally with a wooden skewer or disposable chopstick. Beeswax melts at around 145 degrees F -- this will take 10-15 minutes. Do not heat beeswax directly on a burner or in a microwave, as it can scorch or catch fire.
3. **Prepare the container.** While the wax melts, place the pre-tabbed wick in the center of your candle jar or tin. Dab a small dot of melted wax on the bottom of the wick tab to stick it to the center of the container. Use a wick centering tool, two pencils, or a chopstick laid across the top of the jar to hold the wick straight and centered.
4. **Add essential oil (optional).** Once the wax is fully melted, remove the pitcher from the double boiler and let the wax cool for 2-3 minutes (to about 135 degrees F). If using essential oil, stir in 10-15 drops now. Adding oil to slightly cooled wax helps preserve the fragrance -- essential oils evaporate faster at higher temperatures.
5. **Pour the wax.** Pour the melted beeswax slowly into the prepared container, keeping the wick centered. Leave about 1/2 inch of space at the top. Pour in a steady, thin stream to minimize air bubbles.
6. **Let it cure.** Allow the candle to cool and harden at room temperature for at least 4-6 hours. Do not move the candle while it is cooling, and avoid placing it in the refrigerator -- rapid cooling can cause cracking and sinkholes. If a sinkhole forms around the wick, you can do a second pour: re-melt a small amount of wax and top it off.
7. **Trim the wick.** Once fully hardened, trim the wick to 1/4 inch above the surface of the wax.

## Why It Works

Beeswax is one of the cleanest-burning candle materials available. Unlike paraffin wax, which is a petroleum byproduct, beeswax is a natural substance produced by honeybees. It burns without releasing toxic chemicals, produces very little soot, and has a naturally warm, honey-like scent that does not require added fragrance.

Beeswax also has a higher melting point than soy or paraffin, which means it burns slower and lasts longer. An 8 oz beeswax candle will typically burn for 40-50 hours, compared to 25-35 hours for a soy candle of the same size.

When burned, beeswax releases negative ions that can bind to positively charged particles in the air -- dust, pollen, and other pollutants. This is why beeswax candles are sometimes described as natural air purifiers. The effect is modest in a large room, but in a small space it is noticeable, especially for people with allergies.

## Tips

- **Wick sizing matters.** A wick that is too small will tunnel down the center without melting the wax at the edges. A wick that is too large will produce excess soot and burn through the wax too quickly. For an 8 oz jar (about 3 inches in diameter), a medium-size cotton wick is correct. Check the wick manufacturer's sizing chart if you are unsure.
- **The first burn sets the memory.** The first time you light a beeswax candle, let it burn long enough for the melt pool to reach the edges of the container (typically 1-2 hours). If you blow it out too early, the candle will tunnel on every subsequent burn, wasting wax around the edges.
- **Trim the wick before every burn.** Trim to 1/4 inch each time. A long wick causes a larger flame, more soot, and uneven burning.
- **Use pellets, not blocks.** Beeswax pellets melt much faster and more evenly than blocks, which need to be broken up first.
- **Dedicate your tools.** Beeswax is extremely difficult to clean off of pots, pitchers, and utensils. Use a dedicated pouring pitcher and tools that you reserve for candle making.
- **Clean up with boiling water.** If you do get beeswax on a surface, pour boiling water over it to re-melt and wipe away. Do not pour wax down the drain.
