## Steps

1. **Set up a double boiler.** Fill a saucepan with 2-3 inches of water and place a heat-safe pouring pitcher inside. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.
2. **Melt the beeswax.** Add 8 oz of beeswax pellets to the pitcher. Stir occasionally — this takes 10-15 minutes. Do not heat directly on a burner or in a microwave.
3. **Prepare the container.** Dab melted wax on the wick tab and press it to the center of your jar. Use a wick centering tool or two pencils across the top to hold the wick straight.
4. **Add essential oil (optional).** Remove the pitcher from heat and let the wax cool to about 135 degrees F (2-3 minutes). Stir in 10-15 drops of essential oil.
5. **Pour the wax.** Pour slowly into the container, keeping the wick centered. Leave 1/2 inch of space at the top.
6. **Let it cure.** Cool at room temperature for 4-6 hours. Do not move the candle or refrigerate it. If a sinkhole forms, re-melt a small amount of wax and top it off.
7. **Trim the wick.** Trim to 1/4 inch above the wax surface.

## Why It Works

Beeswax burns without releasing toxic chemicals, produces very little soot, and has a natural honey scent. Its higher melting point means it burns slower — an 8 oz beeswax candle lasts 40-50 hours versus 25-35 for soy. Beeswax releases negative ions that bind to airborne dust, pollen, and pollutants, acting as a modest air purifier in small spaces.

## Tips

- **Wick sizing matters.** Too small tunnels; too large produces soot. Check the manufacturer's sizing chart for your jar diameter.
- **The first burn sets the memory.** Let the melt pool reach the edges (1-2 hours) or it will tunnel on every future burn.
- **Use pellets, not blocks.** Pellets melt faster and more evenly.
- **Dedicate your tools.** Beeswax is extremely difficult to clean off pitchers and utensils. Use dedicated candle-making equipment.
- **Clean up with boiling water.** Pour boiling water over beeswax residue to re-melt and wipe. Do not pour wax down the drain.
