## Steps

1. Pour 1 tablespoon of witch hazel into a 4 oz glass spray bottle. Witch hazel is the emulsifier that prevents essential oils from separating into oily globules floating on the water surface.
2. Add 15-20 drops of essential oil directly into the witch hazel. Choose a single oil or build a blend. Three solid starting points: **Fresh & Clean** (8 drops eucalyptus, 7 drops lemon, 5 drops tea tree), **Warm & Cozy** (8 drops sweet orange, 6 drops cinnamon leaf, 6 drops clove bud), or **Calm & Floral** (10 drops lavender, 5 drops ylang-ylang, 5 drops bergamot).
3. Swirl the bottle gently for a few seconds to let the oils dissolve into the witch hazel.
4. Fill the remainder of the bottle with distilled water. Distilled water prevents mineral buildup in the spray nozzle and extends shelf life by eliminating bacteria found in tap water.
5. Screw on the fine-mist spray top and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
6. To use, shake the bottle, then mist 3-5 sprays into the center of the room at about head height. The fine droplets will hang in the air and disperse throughout the space over the next minute.

## Why It Works

Essential oils are hydrophobic -- they do not dissolve in water on their own. Witch hazel contains a small percentage of natural alcohol (typically 14%) that acts as a co-solvent, creating a bridge between the oil molecules and the water. When you add the oils to the witch hazel first, the alcohol partially solubilizes the oil compounds, forming microdroplets that remain suspended in the water after shaking. This means each spray delivers a consistent mix of water and fragrance rather than random bursts of pure oil or plain water. The fine mist nozzle breaks the liquid into droplets small enough to stay airborne for several seconds, maximizing the surface area exposed to the room's air. As the water evaporates from each droplet, the volatile aromatic compounds -- limonene from citrus oils, linalool from lavender, eugenol from clove -- are released into the surrounding air where they are detected by olfactory receptors in the nose.

## Tips

- **Shake every time.** Even with witch hazel, the oils and water will separate between uses. A vigorous shake before spraying is essential for even scent distribution.
- **Glass bottles only.** Essential oils, particularly citrus oils high in limonene, degrade plastic over time, leaching chemicals and weakening the bottle. Dark amber or cobalt glass also protects the oils from UV degradation.
- **Start with fewer drops.** You can always add more oil to a batch, but you cannot remove it. Begin with 15 drops and increase by 5 if you want a stronger throw after testing.
- **Shelf life is about 2 months.** The fragrance fades as the volatile compounds evaporate through the spray mechanism, even when not in use. Make small batches and refresh often.
- **Avoid spraying near pets.** Many essential oils are toxic to cats (tea tree, eucalyptus, peppermint, citrus) and some are harmful to dogs in concentrated forms. Spray in rooms where pets do not sleep or spend extended time.
- **This is not an air freshener replacement for odor sources.** A room spray masks smells temporarily. If a room smells bad, find and address the source rather than covering it with fragrance.
