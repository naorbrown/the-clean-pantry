## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of sweet almond oil into a narrow-neck glass bottle or vase.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol and swirl gently to combine. The alcohol thins the oil, helping it travel up the reeds.
3. Add 30-40 drops of your chosen essential oil. For a balanced blend, try 15 drops lavender, 10 drops cedarwood, and 10 drops sweet orange.
4. Swirl the bottle gently to mix all the oils together.
5. Insert 6-8 rattan reed sticks into the bottle. The reeds should extend about 6-8 inches above the bottle opening.
6. After 1 hour, flip the reeds so the saturated ends are now pointing up into the air. This kickstarts the scent release.
7. Flip the reeds every 2-3 days to refresh the fragrance intensity.
8. Top off with more carrier oil and essential oil as the level drops, typically every 3-4 weeks.

## Why It Works

Rattan reeds have a natural internal channel structure, similar to tiny drinking straws running the length of the stick. These channels draw liquid upward through capillary action -- the same force that allows a paper towel to absorb water against gravity. The carrier oil wicks up through the channels and evaporates slowly from the exposed top portion of the reeds, carrying the essential oil molecules with it into the air. The rubbing alcohol reduces the viscosity of the oil mixture, accelerating capillary action so the reeds begin diffusing within the first hour rather than the first day. A narrow-neck bottle slows evaporation of the base oil while exposing the reeds to air. Bamboo skewers do not work as well because they lack the internal channel structure of rattan.

## Tips

- Use a narrow-neck bottle to slow evaporation. A wide-mouth jar will lose oil too quickly and may collect dust.
- More reeds mean stronger scent but faster oil consumption. Start with 6 and add more if needed.
- Place the diffuser near a doorway or air vent where airflow will carry the scent through the room.
- Replace the reeds every 2-3 months. Over time, the channels become clogged with dust and dried oil, reducing their wicking ability.
- Do not use bamboo skewers, wooden dowels, or plastic sticks. Only rattan reeds have the internal channel structure needed for capillary wicking.
