## Steps

1. Pour 1/4 cup of sweet almond oil into a narrow-neck glass bottle or vase.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol and swirl gently to combine.
3. Add 30-40 drops of essential oil. Try 15 drops lavender, 10 drops cedarwood, and 10 drops sweet orange.
4. Swirl gently to mix.
5. Insert 6-8 rattan reed sticks. They should extend 6-8 inches above the bottle opening.
6. After 1 hour, flip the reeds so the saturated ends point up into the air.
7. Flip reeds every 2-3 days to refresh the scent.
8. Top off with carrier oil and essential oil every 3-4 weeks.

## Why It Works

Rattan reeds have internal channels that draw liquid upward through capillary action. The carrier oil wicks up and evaporates from the exposed tops, carrying essential oil molecules into the air. Rubbing alcohol thins the oil, accelerating capillary action so reeds begin diffusing within the first hour. A narrow-neck bottle slows base oil evaporation. Bamboo skewers lack rattan's internal channels and do not work well.

## Tips

- More reeds mean stronger scent but faster oil consumption. Start with 6 and add more if needed.
- Place near a doorway or air vent where airflow carries the scent through the room.
- Replace reeds every 2-3 months as channels clog with dust and dried oil.
- Only use rattan reeds — bamboo skewers, dowels, and plastic sticks lack the channel structure needed for wicking.
