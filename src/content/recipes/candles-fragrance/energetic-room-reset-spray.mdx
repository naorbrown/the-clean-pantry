## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of witch hazel into an 8 oz glass spray bottle.
2. Add 10 drops lemon, 5 drops peppermint, and 5 drops rosemary essential oil into the witch hazel. Swirl gently.
3. Fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water (about 1 cup). Screw on the spray top.
4. Shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
5. Shake before each use. Mist 3-5 sprays into the center of the room, corners, and around doorways.
6. For a stronger reset, open a window while spraying to let stale air out.

## Why It Works

Witch hazel emulsifies the oils so they disperse evenly in water instead of floating on the surface. Lemon oil deodorizes and cuts through stale air. Peppermint activates cold receptors in the nose, creating an immediate sensation of freshness. Rosemary supports mental clarity and focus. Together they create a layered scent: bright on first spray (lemon), cool as it develops (peppermint), and grounding as it settles (rosemary).

## Tips

- Avoid spraying directly onto fabrics or curtains — spray into the air and let the mist settle.
- If the scent is too strong, reduce essential oil drops by half.
- Lasts about 2 months. Make a fresh batch when the scent fades.
- For a calming variation, swap peppermint and rosemary for lavender (10 drops) and cedarwood (5 drops).
