## Steps

1. Pour 2 tablespoons of witch hazel into an 8 oz glass spray bottle. Glass is preferred because essential oils can degrade plastic over time.
2. Add 10 drops of lemon essential oil, 5 drops of peppermint essential oil, and 5 drops of rosemary essential oil directly into the witch hazel. Swirl the bottle gently to combine. Adding the oils to the witch hazel first ensures they emulsify when you add the water.
3. Fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water (approximately 1 cup). Screw on the spray top.
4. Shake the bottle vigorously for 10 seconds to combine everything.
5. To use, shake well before each spray. Mist 3-5 sprays into the center of the room, into corners, and around doorways. The scent will disperse throughout the space within a minute or two.
6. For a more intentional reset, open a window briefly while spraying to let stale air out as the fresh scent moves in.

## Why It Works

Witch hazel is a natural emulsifier that allows essential oils to disperse in water rather than floating as an oily film on the surface. Without it, your spray would deliver inconsistent bursts -- some heavy with oil, others with none. Lemon essential oil contains limonene, a compound with natural deodorizing and antibacterial properties that cuts through stale, stuffy air. Peppermint oil contains menthol, which activates cold-sensitive receptors in the nose, creating an immediate sensation of freshness and alertness. Rosemary oil contains 1,8-cineole, a compound studied for its effects on mental clarity and focus. Together, these three oils create a layered scent profile: bright and uplifting on first spray (lemon), cool and energizing as it develops (peppermint), and grounding and focused as it settles (rosemary).

## Tips

- Shake the bottle before every single use. Essential oils and water separate between uses no matter how well you mix them initially. Shaking ensures even distribution with each spray.
- Avoid spraying directly onto fabrics, upholstery, or curtains. Essential oils can stain or leave residue on certain materials. Spray into the air and let the mist settle naturally.
- Use this spray after cleaning a room for a layered fresh effect -- clean surfaces plus a bright scent creates a noticeable reset.
- If you find the scent too strong, reduce the essential oil drops by half. You can always add more, but you cannot take them away once mixed.
- This spray lasts about 2 months. If it starts to smell off or the scent fades significantly, make a fresh batch.
- For a calming variation, swap the peppermint and rosemary for lavender (10 drops) and cedarwood (5 drops).
