## Steps

1. Combine 3 tablespoons of makko powder, 2 tablespoons of sandalwood powder, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon powder, and 1 tablespoon of ground rosemary in a small mixing bowl. Stir thoroughly with a fork until the blend is one uniform color.
2. Add distilled water one tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition. Stop adding water when the mixture forms a smooth, pliable dough that holds its shape when pinched. It should feel like dense cookie dough -- moist enough to mold but not sticky. This usually takes 4-6 tablespoons depending on humidity.
3. Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a large marble (roughly 1 tablespoon). Roll it into a ball between your palms, then shape it into a cone by pressing and tapering one end to a point. The finished cone should be about 1 inch tall and 3/4 inch wide at the base.
4. Press the base of each cone firmly against the work surface to create a flat bottom. This ensures the cone stands upright during burning.
5. Repeat until all the dough is shaped into cones. You should get 20-25 cones from this batch.
6. Place the cones on a wire rack or parchment paper with at least 1 inch between each one for airflow. Dry at room temperature for 24 hours, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.
7. Test for dryness by pressing a cone firmly between your fingers. It should feel completely hard with no soft spots or give. If it still feels slightly damp, give it another 12 hours.
8. To burn, place a cone on a fireproof surface, light the pointed tip with a match or lighter, and let it flame for about 5 seconds until the tip glows red. Blow out the flame. The cone will smolder from tip to base over 15-20 minutes, producing a steady trail of fragrant smoke.

## Why It Works

Cone incense works on the same principle as stick incense but with a simpler construction. Makko powder provides the combustible binder, and its cellulose fibers hold the cone's shape while allowing a slow, self-sustaining burn. The cone shape is significant: the narrow tip ignites easily with a small flame, and the gradually widening cross-section means the burning surface area increases over time, producing progressively more smoke and fragrance as the cone burns down. This creates a scent experience that builds rather than fading. Because the cone is solid (no bamboo core to compete with the aromatics), every molecule of smoke comes from the herb and resin blend. The lower combustion temperature of makko-bound incense compared to charcoal-based commercial cones means the aromatic compounds volatilize rather than combust, preserving their character instead of breaking them down into generic smoke.

## Tips

- Keep your cone dimensions consistent for even burn times. A cone that is too fat at the base may extinguish itself because the ember cannot sustain combustion through the thicker cross-section.
- If cones crack during drying, the dough was too dry. Add slightly more water next time. Surface cracks are cosmetic, but deep cracks can cause the cone to split and extinguish during burning.
- For a sweeter profile, replace the rosemary with 1 tablespoon of ground clove. For a woody, meditative scent, use 2 tablespoons of cedar powder and 1 tablespoon of dried juniper berry powder instead of the sandalwood and rosemary.
- Store finished cones in a glass jar with a tight lid. They stay fragrant for 6-12 months at room temperature.
- Do not use a food dehydrator or oven to speed drying. Heat drives off the aromatic oils you worked to include.
- Makko powder is available from incense supply shops and online. There is no effective substitute -- flour, cornstarch, and gum arabic do not combust in the same self-sustaining way.
