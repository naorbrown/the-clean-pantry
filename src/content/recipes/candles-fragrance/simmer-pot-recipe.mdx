## Steps

1. Add 6 cups of water to a medium saucepan.
2. Slice the orange into thin rounds (about 1/4 inch thick) and add them to the pot, peel and all.
3. Add the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and star anise pods.
4. Add the rosemary sprigs and vanilla extract.
5. Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately reduce to the lowest simmer setting. You want gentle wisps of steam, not a rolling boil.
6. Let the pot simmer with the lid off for up to 2 hours, checking the water level every 20-30 minutes. Add more water when the level drops below 1 inch.
7. When done, turn off the heat and let the pot cool. Cover and refrigerate.
8. Reheat and reuse for up to 3 days. Add a splash of fresh water and a few more drops of vanilla extract each time you reheat.

## Why It Works

A simmer pot works because heat accelerates the evaporation of volatile aromatic compounds from the ingredients into the surrounding air. Each ingredient contributes specific molecules: oranges release limonene from their peel oil, cinnamon releases cinnamaldehyde, cloves release eugenol, star anise releases anethole, rosemary releases camphor and 1,8-cineole, and vanilla releases vanillin. The warm steam acts as a vehicle, carrying these lightweight molecules throughout the house far more effectively than a cold arrangement of the same ingredients could. Because each compound has a different molecular weight and vapor pressure, they evaporate at different rates, creating a fragrance that evolves over the simmering time. The heavier vanilla and clove notes linger longest, while the bright citrus notes refresh the scent continually.

## Tips

- Use the lowest possible heat setting. A gentle simmer maximizes fragrance time while minimizing water loss. If your smallest burner still boils on low, use a heat diffuser plate.
- Simmer pots are an excellent way to use citrus peels, apple cores, and herb stems that would otherwise be compost. Freeze scraps until you have enough.
- For a spring version, swap orange for lemon, replace cinnamon with fresh mint, and use thyme instead of rosemary.
- The pot contents do not need to look pretty. Browning and softening of the ingredients is normal and does not affect the fragrance.
- Do not add sugar or honey. They caramelize and burn on the bottom of the pot, creating a cleaning headache and an acrid smell.
