## Steps

1. Add 6 cups of water to a medium saucepan.
2. Slice the orange into thin rounds (about 1/4 inch thick) and add them peel and all.
3. Add the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and star anise pods.
4. Add the rosemary sprigs and vanilla extract.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce to the lowest simmer setting — gentle wisps of steam, not a rolling boil.
6. Simmer with the lid off for up to 2 hours. Check water level every 20-30 minutes and top off when it drops below 1 inch.
7. Turn off heat, let cool, cover, and refrigerate.
8. Reheat and reuse for up to 3 days. Add fresh water and a few drops of vanilla each time.

## Why It Works

Heat accelerates the evaporation of aromatic compounds into the air. Each ingredient contributes: orange peel releases limonene, cinnamon releases cinnamaldehyde, cloves release eugenol, star anise releases anethole, and vanilla releases vanillin. Steam carries these molecules throughout the house. Because each compound evaporates at a different rate, the fragrance evolves — bright citrus dominates first, then heavy vanilla and clove notes linger longest.

## Tips

- Use the lowest possible heat. If your smallest burner still boils on low, use a heat diffuser plate.
- Great way to use citrus peels, apple cores, and herb stems you would otherwise compost. Freeze scraps until you have enough.
- Spring version: swap orange for lemon, cinnamon for fresh mint, rosemary for thyme.
- Do not add sugar or honey — they caramelize and burn, creating an acrid smell.
