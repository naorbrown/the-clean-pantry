## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a heat-safe glass measuring cup or metal pouring pitcher inside a saucepan with 2-3 inches of simmering water. Add 6 oz of soy wax flakes and 1 tablespoon of refined coconut oil to the pitcher.
2. Melt the wax over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden skewer. Soy wax melts at approximately 120-130 degrees F and will be fully liquid within 10 minutes.
3. Remove the pitcher from the double boiler and let the wax cool for 3-5 minutes until it reaches about 135 degrees F. If you do not have a thermometer, wait until the wax is warm but not steaming.
4. Add 40-50 drops of essential oil and stir for 30 seconds to distribute evenly throughout the wax.
5. Pour the scented wax into silicone mold cavities, filling each about 3/4 full. Pour slowly to avoid air bubbles.
6. Wait 3-5 minutes for a thin skin to form on the surface of the wax. The wax should be starting to turn opaque around the edges but still soft enough to accept pressed items.
7. Gently press dried flowers, herb sprigs, and botanicals into the surface of each sachet. Arrange them decoratively -- they will be visible through the translucent wax. Press them about halfway into the surface so they are anchored but still visible.
8. Cut a drinking straw to 1 inch in length and insert it vertically into the top edge of each sachet, about 1/4 inch from the rim. This creates the hole for hanging ribbon. Make sure the straw goes all the way through to the bottom of the mold.
9. Let the sachets cool completely at room temperature for 1.5-2 hours. Do not refrigerate -- rapid cooling causes the wax to crack and pull away from the mold unevenly.
10. Once fully hardened, flex the silicone mold to release each sachet. Remove the straw piece by pushing it out with a skewer. Thread a 6-inch piece of ribbon or twine through the hole and tie a loop for hanging.

## Why It Works

Soy wax has a lower melting point (120-130 degrees F) than paraffin or beeswax, which means it softens slightly at room temperature, creating a slow, passive release of the essential oil compounds trapped within its matrix. The wax acts as an encapsulation medium -- when the essential oils are stirred into melted wax and the wax solidifies, the oil molecules become distributed throughout the wax structure. As the wax surface is exposed to air, the volatile aromatic compounds gradually migrate to the surface and evaporate. The coconut oil lowers the melting point slightly further and increases the porosity of the solidified wax, improving fragrance throw. Dried botanicals serve a dual purpose: they are decorative, and their own residual volatile oils contribute subtle fragrance notes that complement the essential oils. In enclosed spaces like closets and drawers, the fragrance reaches a noticeable concentration because the air volume is small and turnover is low.

## Tips

- **Press botanicals at the right moment.** If the wax is too liquid, the flowers sink to the bottom. If it is too firm, they will not adhere. The surface should be the consistency of soft butter -- opaque at the edges, slightly tacky in the center.
- **Choose botanicals that keep their color.** Lavender buds, small rosebuds, chamomile flowers, dried citrus slices, and small leaves like thyme hold up well. Avoid fresh flowers -- they contain moisture that creates bubbles and mold in the wax.
- **Refresh old sachets.** When the scent fades (typically after 2-3 months), place the sachet on a warming plate or in a sunny window for 10 minutes. The gentle heat softens the surface layer and releases a fresh burst of trapped fragrance.
- **Hanging locations matter.** These work best in enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces: closets, wardrobes, dresser drawers, bathroom cabinets, and cars. In an open room, the fragrance dissipates too quickly to be noticeable.
- **Do not confuse these with wax melts.** Wax sachets are designed to release fragrance passively at room temperature. Do not place them in a wax warmer -- the botanicals will burn and create an unpleasant smell.
- **Make them as gifts.** Wrap each sachet in tissue paper or a small organza bag. They last months, look beautiful, and cost a fraction of store-bought versions.
