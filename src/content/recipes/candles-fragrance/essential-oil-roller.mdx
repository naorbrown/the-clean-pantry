## Steps

1. Remove the roller ball cap from a clean 10 mL glass roller bottle.
2. Add 2 drops of your base note oil (cedarwood, sandalwood, or vetiver).
3. Add 4 drops of your middle note oil (lavender, rosemary, or geranium).
4. Add 4 drops of your top note oil (citrus, peppermint, or eucalyptus).
5. Fill the remainder of the bottle with jojoba oil, leaving space to replace the roller ball.
6. Press the roller ball firmly back into the bottle neck until it clicks. Cap the bottle.
7. Roll between your palms for 30 seconds to blend.
8. Apply to pulse points: inner wrists, behind ears, base of throat, and inner elbows.

## Why It Works

Top notes (citrus, mint) are light molecules that evaporate first, lasting 15-30 minutes. Middle notes (floral, herbal) emerge next, lasting 2-4 hours. Base notes (wood, earth) anchor the scent for up to 8 hours. Jojoba oil closely resembles human sebum and absorbs slowly, extending release time. Body heat at pulse points accelerates evaporation, projecting the fragrance. The 2:4:4 ratio ensures smooth transitions between stages.

## Tips

- Use glass bottles only — essential oils degrade plastic over time.
- The blend matures over 24-48 hours as the oils marry.
- Store away from direct sunlight and heat.
- Calming blend: 4 drops lavender, 4 drops chamomile, 2 drops vetiver.
- Energizing blend: 4 drops grapefruit, 4 drops rosemary, 2 drops peppermint.
