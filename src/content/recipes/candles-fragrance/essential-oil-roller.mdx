## Steps

1. Remove the roller ball cap from a clean 10 mL glass roller bottle.
2. Add 2 drops of your base note essential oil first (cedarwood, sandalwood, or vetiver). Base notes are the heaviest and longest-lasting.
3. Add 4 drops of your middle note oil (lavender, rosemary, or geranium). Middle notes form the core of the fragrance.
4. Add 4 drops of your top note oil (citrus, peppermint, or eucalyptus). Top notes are the first scent you detect.
5. Fill the remainder of the bottle with jojoba oil, leaving just enough space to replace the roller ball.
6. Press the roller ball firmly back into the bottle neck until it clicks into place. Cap the bottle.
7. Roll the bottle between your palms for 30 seconds to blend the oils together.
8. Apply to pulse points: inner wrists, behind ears, base of throat, and inner elbows.

## Why It Works

Essential oil roller blends follow the principles of classical perfumery, using a three-tier fragrance structure. Top notes (citrus, mint) are small, light molecules that evaporate first, providing the initial scent impression that lasts 15-30 minutes. Middle notes (floral, herbal) are medium-weight molecules that emerge as the top notes fade, lasting 2-4 hours and forming the heart of the fragrance. Base notes (wood, earth) are the heaviest molecules, evaporating last and anchoring the scent for up to 8 hours. Jojoba oil is the ideal carrier because it closely resembles human sebum and is absorbed slowly, extending the release time of the essential oils. Applied to pulse points, body heat accelerates evaporation of the oils, projecting the fragrance. The 2:4:4 base-middle-top ratio creates a balanced blend where each stage transitions smoothly.

## Tips

- Glass bottles are essential. Essential oils, especially citrus oils, degrade plastic over time, potentially leaching chemicals.
- The blend will mature over 24-48 hours as the oils marry. The scent you smell immediately after mixing will change slightly.
- Store roller bottles away from direct sunlight and heat. UV light degrades essential oils and shortens shelf life.
- For a calming blend: 4 drops lavender (top), 4 drops chamomile (middle), 2 drops vetiver (base).
- For an energizing blend: 4 drops grapefruit (top), 4 drops rosemary (middle), 2 drops peppermint (base).
