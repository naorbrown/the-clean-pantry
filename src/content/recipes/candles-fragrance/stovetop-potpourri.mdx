## Steps

1. Fill a medium saucepan with 6-8 cups of water and place it on the stove over medium-high heat.
2. While the water heats, slice one large orange into rounds about 1/4 inch thick. Include the peel -- that is where most of the aromatic oil lives. Add all slices to the pot.
3. Add 3 cinnamon sticks, breaking them in half if they are longer than 4 inches. Breaking exposes more surface area and releases cinnamaldehyde faster.
4. Drop in 1 tablespoon of whole cloves. They will sink to the bottom, which is fine -- the hot water extracts their aromatic compounds whether they float or not.
5. Add 3-4 fresh rosemary sprigs. Crush them lightly between your palms before dropping them in to bruise the leaves and release their oils.
6. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir everything once.
7. Bring the pot to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting that still produces gentle wisps of steam. You want a barely-there simmer, not a rolling boil.
8. Leave the lid off so the aromatic steam can escape into the room. Check the water level every 20-30 minutes and add another cup of water whenever it drops below 2 inches.
9. Simmer for 2-4 hours, or as long as you want the fragrance. When finished, let the pot cool, then strain and discard the solids. The liquid cannot be saved for reuse once the volatile compounds have evaporated.

## Why It Works

This recipe uses fresh ingredients rather than dried ones because fresh plant material contains significantly more volatile aromatic oil than its dried counterpart. A fresh orange peel contains up to 5% limonene by weight, while dried peel retains less than 1% after weeks of storage. Fresh rosemary leaves have intact oil glands (trichomes) that burst and release camphor, alpha-pinene, and 1,8-cineole when heated. Cinnamon sticks release cinnamaldehyde from their bark oil, cloves release eugenol, and vanilla extract contributes vanillin -- each at a different rate based on their molecular weight and volatility. The warm water acts as a heat reservoir, maintaining a stable temperature that volatilizes aromatic compounds without destroying them. Steam then carries these lightweight molecules throughout the house. Because each ingredient has a different vapor pressure, the scent evolves over time: bright citrus dominates the first 30 minutes, spicy cinnamon and clove sustain through the middle hours, and warm vanilla lingers longest.

## Tips

- This recipe is designed around fresh ingredients. If you want a dried-ingredient simmer pot or one that can be reheated for several days, see the [Seasonal Simmer Pot](/recipes/candles-fragrance/simmer-pot-recipe) recipe.
- Slice the oranges thin. Thinner slices mean more exposed peel surface area, which means more limonene released into the steam.
- Use any citrus you have on hand. Lemons produce a brighter, sharper scent. Grapefruit adds a slightly bitter, sophisticated note. Mixing citrus varieties creates complexity.
- The pot contents will brown and soften over the hours. This is normal and does not affect the fragrance. What you see is Maillard browning and cell breakdown, both of which can actually release additional aromatic compounds.
- For a holiday variation, add 3 star anise pods and 4-5 cardamom pods (lightly crushed) along with the cloves. This shifts the profile toward a mulled cider or chai direction.
- Never add sugar, honey, or fruit juice. Sugars caramelize and eventually burn on the bottom of the pot, creating a bitter, acrid smell and a difficult cleanup.
- This works best when you are already home and monitoring the stove. If you want an unattended fragrance option, use a slow cooker on the low setting with the lid cracked open.
