## Steps

1. **Set up a double boiler.** Fill a saucepan with 2-3 inches of water. Place a heat-safe pouring pitcher inside. Bring to a gentle simmer.
2. **Melt the beeswax.** Add 4 oz of beeswax pellets to the pitcher. Stir occasionally — this takes 10-15 minutes.
3. **Add the coconut oil.** Stir in 2 oz of refined coconut oil until fully combined.
4. **Cool slightly.** Remove from heat and let cool to about 135 degrees F (3-5 minutes).
5. **Add essential oils.** Stir in 40-50 drops of essential oil for 30 seconds.
6. **Pour into molds.** Pour into silicone mold trays, filling each cavity about 3/4 full. Pour slowly to minimize air bubbles.
7. **Let them cure.** Cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Do not refrigerate.
8. **Pop them out.** Flex the silicone mold to release the hardened melts.

## Why It Works

Beeswax holds its shape at room temperature but melts cleanly in an electric warmer (120-150 degrees F). Coconut oil lowers the melting point so melts release scent faster and more evenly. Refined coconut oil has almost no scent, so it does not compete with the essential oils. The 2:1 beeswax-to-coconut ratio balances firmness and melt speed. In hot climates, increase to 3:1 to prevent softening on the shelf.

## Alternative

If you prefer soy wax, substitute 6 oz of soy wax flakes for the beeswax and coconut oil combination (soy wax already has a low melting point and does not need the coconut oil). The process is identical. Soy melts produce a slightly stronger scent throw than beeswax but do not last as long per melt.
## Tips

- **Seasonal blends.** Spring: lavender + lemon (25 + 25). Summer: peppermint + eucalyptus. Fall: cinnamon + orange (15 + 35). Winter: fir needle + cedarwood.
- For stronger scent, increase to 60 drops. Beyond 60 drops, oil may not bind fully and can pool.
- **Silicone molds are essential.** Rigid plastic makes removal difficult.
- **Dedicate your tools.** Beeswax is extremely difficult to clean off pitchers and utensils.
- Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Scent lasts 6-12 months.
- Use one melt per warmer session.
