## Steps

1. **Set up a double boiler.** Fill a medium saucepan with 2-3 inches of water. Place a heat-safe glass or metal pouring pitcher inside it. Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.
2. **Melt the beeswax.** Add 4 oz of beeswax pellets to the pitcher. Stir occasionally with a wooden skewer or disposable chopstick. Beeswax melts at around 145 degrees F and will take 10-15 minutes.
3. **Add the coconut oil.** Once the beeswax is fully melted, add 2 oz of refined coconut oil and stir until completely combined. The coconut oil lowers the melting point of the final product, which helps it release fragrance more readily in an electric warmer.
4. **Cool slightly.** Remove the pitcher from the double boiler and let the wax mixture cool for 3-5 minutes, until it reaches approximately 135 degrees F. Adding essential oils to wax that is too hot causes the volatile compounds to flash off, wasting both the oil and the scent.
5. **Add essential oils.** Stir in 40-50 drops of your chosen essential oil blend. Stir for 30 seconds to distribute the oil evenly throughout the wax.
6. **Pour into molds.** Pour the scented wax into silicone mold trays -- standard ice cube trays, silicone muffin molds, or dedicated wax melt molds all work. Fill each cavity about 3/4 full. Pour slowly to minimize air bubbles.
7. **Let them cure.** Allow the wax melts to cool and harden at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Do not put them in the refrigerator -- rapid cooling can cause cracking and uneven texture.
8. **Pop them out.** Once fully hardened, flex the silicone mold to release the melts. They should pop out cleanly.

## Why It Works

Beeswax provides the structural base -- it is hard enough to hold its shape at room temperature but melts cleanly at the low temperatures of an electric wax warmer (typically 120-150 degrees F). On its own, beeswax is very hard and has a high melting point, which means it can take a long time to fully melt in a warmer and may not release fragrance efficiently.

Adding coconut oil solves this problem. Coconut oil softens the wax and lowers its melting point, so the melts begin releasing scent faster and more evenly. Refined coconut oil has almost no scent of its own, so it does not compete with the essential oils.

The 2:1 ratio of beeswax to coconut oil is the sweet spot -- hard enough to hold shape in warm rooms, soft enough to melt quickly in a warmer. If you live in a very hot climate, increase the beeswax proportion to 3:1 to prevent the melts from softening on the shelf.

## Tips

- **Scent blends for seasons.** Spring: lavender and lemon (25 + 25 drops). Summer: peppermint and eucalyptus (25 + 25). Fall: cinnamon and orange (15 + 35). Winter: fir needle and cedarwood (25 + 25).
- **Scent strength.** If you prefer a stronger throw, increase the essential oil to 60 drops per batch. Beyond 60 drops, you risk the oil not binding fully with the wax, which can cause pooling and uneven scent.
- **Silicone molds are essential.** Do not use rigid plastic molds -- the wax will be difficult to remove. Silicone flexes, allowing clean release every time.
- **Dedicate your tools.** Beeswax is extremely difficult to clean off of pitchers and utensils. Use equipment reserved for wax projects.
- **Storage.** Store unused melts in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They will retain their scent for 6-12 months.
- **One at a time.** Use one wax melt per warmer session. The scent should fill a standard room within 15-20 minutes.

## Alternative

If you prefer soy wax, substitute 6 oz of soy wax flakes for the beeswax and coconut oil combination (soy wax already has a low melting point and does not need the coconut oil). The process is identical. Soy melts produce a slightly stronger scent throw than beeswax but do not last as long per melt.
