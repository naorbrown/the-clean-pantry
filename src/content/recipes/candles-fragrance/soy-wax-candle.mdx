## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a pouring pitcher inside a saucepan filled with 2-3 inches of water. Bring the water to a low simmer.
2. Add 8 oz of soy wax flakes to the pitcher. Stir occasionally with a wooden skewer. Soy wax melts at about 120-180 degrees F and will take 10-12 minutes.
3. While the wax melts, prepare the container. Dab a small dot of melted wax on the bottom of the wick tab and press it firmly to the center of your container. Position the wick centering tool across the top to keep the wick straight.
4. Once the wax is fully melted and clear, remove the pitcher from heat. Let it cool to approximately 135 degrees F (about 3-4 minutes off heat).
5. Add 1 oz of essential oil to the wax and stir slowly for 2 full minutes. Slow stirring ensures even distribution without introducing air bubbles.
6. Pour the wax slowly into the container in a steady, thin stream. Leave about 1/2 inch of headroom at the top.
7. Allow the candle to cool undisturbed at room temperature for 4-6 hours. Do not move it, and avoid placing it in the refrigerator.
8. Once fully hardened, trim the wick to 1/4 inch above the wax surface. If a sinkhole forms around the wick, melt a small amount of extra wax and pour a thin top layer.

## Why It Works

Soy wax is derived from hydrogenated soybean oil, making it a renewable, biodegradable candle material. It burns at a lower temperature than paraffin (about 20 degrees cooler), which means it burns more slowly and produces a longer-lasting candle. The lower burn temperature also means the wax pool releases fragrance molecules more gradually, creating a subtler, more sustained scent throw. Soy wax produces significantly less soot than paraffin because it contains no petroleum-derived hydrocarbons. The essential oils bind to the soy wax molecules during the cooling process and are released as the wax melts during burning. Adding the oil at 135 degrees F rather than at peak temperature is critical -- too-hot wax causes rapid evaporation of the volatile fragrance compounds before the candle ever gets lit.

## Tips

- The first burn is the most important. Let the melt pool reach the edges of the container (1-2 hours for an 8 oz jar). This prevents tunneling on all future burns.
- Soy wax has a "memory" -- if you extinguish it before the pool reaches the edges, it will tunnel down the center every time after.
- Trim the wick to 1/4 inch before every burn. This prevents mushrooming (the carbon ball that forms on untrimmed wicks) and reduces soot.
- For stronger scent throw, use fragrance oils rated for candle making instead of essential oils. Essential oils are subtler but more natural.
- Soy candles may develop a white crystalline coating on the surface called "frosting." This is purely cosmetic and does not affect performance.
