## Steps

1. Set up a double boiler by placing a pouring pitcher inside a saucepan with 2-3 inches of water. Bring to a low simmer.
2. Add 8 oz of soy wax flakes. Stir occasionally — melting takes 10-12 minutes.
3. While the wax melts, dab melted wax on the wick tab and press it to the center of your container. Position the centering tool across the top.
4. Once wax is fully melted and clear, remove from heat. Cool to about 135 degrees F (3-4 minutes off heat).
5. Add 1 oz of essential oil and stir slowly for 2 full minutes.
6. Pour slowly into the container. Leave 1/2 inch of headroom.
7. Cool undisturbed at room temperature for 4-6 hours. Do not move or refrigerate.
8. Trim the wick to 1/4 inch. If a sinkhole forms, melt extra wax and pour a thin top layer.

## Why It Works

Soy wax is renewable, biodegradable, and burns about 20 degrees cooler than paraffin, producing less soot and a longer-lasting candle. The lower temperature releases fragrance gradually for sustained scent throw. Essential oils bind to soy wax during cooling and release when the wax melts during burning. Adding oil at 135 degrees F is critical — hotter wax causes fragrance compounds to evaporate before the candle is ever lit.

## Tips

- Let the first burn's melt pool reach the edges (1-2 hours). Soy wax has a "memory" — extinguishing early causes permanent tunneling.
- Trim the wick to 1/4 inch before every burn to prevent mushrooming and soot.
- For stronger scent, use fragrance oils rated for candle making instead of essential oils.
- White crystalline "frosting" on the surface is purely cosmetic and does not affect performance.
