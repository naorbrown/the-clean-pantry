## Steps

1. Pour 2 oz of witch hazel into a 4 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 20 drops of essential oil that matches or complements your potpourri blend. For a traditional floral potpourri, try 10 drops rose geranium and 10 drops lavender.
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin and swirl gently.
4. Fill the remainder of the bottle with distilled water.
5. Cap and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
6. Spread the potpourri in a single layer on newspaper or a tray. Mist lightly from about 10 inches above, spraying 4-6 pumps evenly across the surface.
7. Toss the potpourri gently with your hands to distribute the moisture, then let it air dry for 30 minutes before returning it to its display bowl.
8. Repeat every 2-3 weeks to maintain fragrance strength.

## Why It Works

Potpourri loses scent as its volatile oils evaporate over time. This spray reloads the dried materials with fresh essential oil. Witch hazel helps the oil penetrate the surface of petals, bark, and pods rather than sitting on top. Vegetable glycerin creates a slightly tacky surface that holds the oil in place longer. Distilled water prevents mineral deposits that would leave white residue.

## Tips

- Mist lightly — over-saturating causes mold and turns dried materials mushy.
- If potpourri has lost color and scent, it is beyond refreshing. Start with fresh botanicals.
- Add 2-3 drops of oil directly onto dense wood or bark pieces for slow release.
- Holiday blend: 10 drops cinnamon, 5 drops clove, 5 drops sweet orange.
