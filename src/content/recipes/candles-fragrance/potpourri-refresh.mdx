## Steps

1. Pour 2 oz of witch hazel into a 4 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 20 drops of essential oil that matches or complements your potpourri blend. For a traditional floral potpourri, try 10 drops rose geranium and 10 drops lavender.
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin and swirl gently.
4. Fill the remainder of the bottle with distilled water.
5. Cap and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
6. Spread the potpourri in a single layer on newspaper or a tray. Mist lightly from about 10 inches above, spraying 4-6 pumps evenly across the surface.
7. Toss the potpourri gently with your hands to distribute the moisture, then let it air dry for 30 minutes before returning it to its display bowl.
8. Repeat every 2-3 weeks to maintain fragrance strength.

## Why It Works

Dried potpourri loses its scent because the volatile essential oil molecules trapped in the dried plant material evaporate gradually into the air. Once those natural oils are depleted, the dried botanicals become essentially scentless. This refresh spray reloads the dried materials with fresh essential oil. The witch hazel acts as a carrier solvent that helps the essential oil penetrate the surface of the dried petals, bark, and pods rather than just sitting on top. Vegetable glycerin is a humectant -- it attracts moisture from the air and creates a slightly tacky surface on the dried botanicals that holds the essential oil in place longer, extending the time between refreshes. Distilled water is used instead of tap water to avoid mineral deposits that would leave a white residue on the dried materials.

## Tips

- Mist lightly. Over-saturating potpourri causes mold growth and turns the dried materials mushy.
- If your potpourri has lost its color as well as its scent, it is beyond refreshing. Start with fresh dried botanicals.
- Store extra spray in a cool, dark place. Essential oils degrade in sunlight.
- You can also add 2-3 drops of essential oil directly onto a few pieces of dried wood or bark in the potpourri. These dense pieces absorb and slowly release oil better than delicate petals.
- For a holiday refresh, use 10 drops cinnamon, 5 drops clove, and 5 drops sweet orange oil.
