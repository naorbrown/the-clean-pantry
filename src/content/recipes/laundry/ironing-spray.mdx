## Steps

1. Pour 1.5 cups of water into a 16 oz spray bottle. Distilled water prevents mineral spots on dark fabrics.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. Do not worry about the smell -- it disappears completely as the fabric dries.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol.
4. Add 5-10 drops of essential oil if you want a light scent. Lavender and lemon both work well.
5. Cap the bottle and shake gently to combine.
6. To use, spray the wrinkled garment lightly from about 8-10 inches away until the fabric is slightly damp but not soaked.
7. Smooth the fabric with your hands, gently pulling and tugging wrinkles flat. Hang the garment and let it air dry.

## Why It Works

Vinegar is a mild acid that relaxes the bonds between fabric fibers, allowing wrinkles to release when the fabric is smoothed and pulled taut. The rubbing alcohol lowers the surface tension of the water, helping the spray penetrate the fabric evenly rather than beading up on the surface. It also speeds evaporation, so garments dry faster and are less likely to develop water spots. The combination works on most cotton, linen, and synthetic blend fabrics without the heat damage that ironing can cause.

## Tips

- For stubborn wrinkles, spray more generously and hang the garment in the bathroom while you shower. The steam combined with the spray loosens fibers faster.
- This spray works especially well on dress shirts, curtains, and tablecloths that have been stored folded.
- Shake the bottle before each use to redistribute the ingredients.
- Store at room temperature out of direct sunlight. The spray stays effective for 2-3 months.
- For a travel version, fill a 3 oz bottle to keep in your suitcase.

## Alternative

If you prefer to skip the vinegar entirely, use 2 tablespoons of a good-quality liquid fabric softener (plant-based, not synthetic) mixed with 2 cups of water. This version smells pleasant without essential oil and works well on cotton and blends. However, avoid using fabric softener sprays on athletic or moisture-wicking fabrics, as the softener coats fibers and reduces their wicking ability.
