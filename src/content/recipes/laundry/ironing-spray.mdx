## Steps

1. Pour 1.5 cups of water into a 16 oz spray bottle.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of rubbing alcohol.
3. Add 5-10 drops of essential oil if desired.
4. Cap and shake gently to combine.
5. Spray the wrinkled garment from 8-10 inches away until slightly damp.
6. Smooth the fabric with your hands, pulling wrinkles flat. Hang and let air dry.

## Why It Works

Vinegar relaxes the bonds between fabric fibers, allowing wrinkles to release when smoothed. Rubbing alcohol lowers surface tension so the spray penetrates evenly, and speeds evaporation to prevent water spots. The combination works on cotton, linen, and blends without heat damage.

## Alternative

If you prefer to skip the vinegar entirely, use 2 tablespoons of a good-quality liquid fabric softener (plant-based, not synthetic) mixed with 2 cups of water. This version smells pleasant without essential oil and works well on cotton and blends. However, avoid using fabric softener sprays on athletic or moisture-wicking fabrics, as the softener coats fibers and reduces their wicking ability.
## Tips

- For stubborn wrinkles, hang the garment in the bathroom while you shower after spraying.
- Shake before each use. Store at room temperature out of direct sunlight for up to 2-3 months.
- For travel, fill a 3 oz bottle to keep in your suitcase.
