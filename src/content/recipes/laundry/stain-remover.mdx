## Steps

1. Mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 teaspoon of liquid castile soap in a small bowl to form a paste.
2. Test the paste on a hidden seam or inside hem of the garment to check for discoloration. Wait 5 minutes and inspect.
3. Apply the paste directly to the stain, pressing it gently into the fabric with your fingers or an old toothbrush.
4. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. For stubborn stains, allow up to an hour.
5. Rinse the treated area with cool water to remove the paste.
6. Launder the garment as usual.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide breaks the bonds in colored stain molecules, bleaching them without the harshness of chlorine. Baking soda provides gentle abrasion to lift the stain from fibers. Castile soap emulsifies grease and suspends loosened particles so they rinse away.

## Alternative

For protein-based stains (blood, sweat, egg), soak the fabric in cold salt water (2 tablespoons salt per cup of water) for 30 minutes before washing. Never use hot water on protein stains, as heat sets them permanently.

## Tips

- Mix only what you need for each application. The paste loses potency once hydrogen peroxide is exposed to air and light.
- For grease stains, sprinkle plain baking soda on the spot first, let it absorb for 10 minutes, brush it off, then apply the paste.
- Always use 3% hydrogen peroxide (the standard drugstore concentration). Higher concentrations can damage fabric.
