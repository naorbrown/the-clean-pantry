## Steps

1. Fill a basin, sink, or bathtub with enough hot water to fully submerge your laundry items.
2. Add 1 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the water. Stir to distribute evenly.
3. Submerge white or light-colored items in the solution. Push them down so all fabric is below the waterline.
4. Soak for 30 minutes to 1 hour. For yellowed or heavily stained whites, soak for up to 2 hours.
5. Remove the items and wash them in the washing machine on a normal cycle with your regular detergent.
6. Dry as usual. For extra brightening, dry whites in direct sunlight — UV light naturally bleaches fabric.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxygen-based bleach that oxidizes stain molecules, rendering them colorless. It breaks down into water and oxygen, leaving no residue. Lemon juice acts as a mild bleaching agent and lowers pH, enhancing peroxide's oxidizing power. The combination is more effective than either ingredient alone.

## Alternative

- For a machine-based approach, add 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide directly to the bleach dispenser of your washing machine. Run a hot water cycle. This is less effective than a soak but more convenient for regular maintenance.
- Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is another effective natural whitener. Add 1/2 cup to your wash cycle along with regular detergent. It boosts cleaning power and brightens whites through alkaline action rather than oxidation.
## Tips

- Always use fresh 3% hydrogen peroxide stored in its original opaque container.
- For targeted stains, apply peroxide directly to the spot for 10 minutes before the full soak.
- Add 1/2 cup of baking soda to the soak for extra deodorizing power on gym clothes or musty linens.
- The brightening effect is cumulative — use every 3 to 4 washes for best results.
