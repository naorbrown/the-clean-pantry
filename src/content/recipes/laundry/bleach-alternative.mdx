## Steps

1. Fill a basin, sink, or bathtub with enough hot water to fully submerge your laundry items.
2. Add 1 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the water. Stir to distribute evenly.
3. Submerge white or light-colored items in the solution. Push them down so all fabric is below the waterline.
4. Soak for 30 minutes to 1 hour. For yellowed or heavily stained whites, soak for up to 2 hours.
5. Remove the items and wash them in the washing machine on a normal cycle with your regular detergent.
6. Dry as usual. For extra brightening, dry whites in direct sunlight — UV light naturally bleaches fabric.

## Why It Works

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxygen-based bleach. When it breaks down, it releases oxygen radicals that react with the chromophores (color-producing molecules) in stains and yellowing. This oxidation process breaks apart the stain molecules, rendering them colorless. Unlike chlorine bleach, hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen, leaving no chemical residue on fabric. Lemon juice contains citric acid, which acts as a mild bleaching agent on its own and also lowers the pH of the solution, enhancing the oxidizing power of hydrogen peroxide. The combination is significantly more effective than either ingredient used alone.

## Tips

- Always use fresh 3% hydrogen peroxide. It degrades when exposed to light, so check that your bottle is not expired and has been stored in its original opaque container.
- This treatment is excellent for removing yellowing from white t-shirts, bed sheets, and cloth napkins that have dulled over time.
- For targeted stain treatment, apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the stain before soaking. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then proceed with the full soak.
- Do not use this solution on silk or wool. Hydrogen peroxide can damage protein-based fibers.
- Add 1/2 cup of baking soda to the soak for extra deodorizing power, particularly useful for gym clothes or musty linens.
- The brightening effect is cumulative. Regular use every 3 to 4 washes will keep whites noticeably brighter than detergent alone.

## Alternative

- For a machine-based approach, add 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide directly to the bleach dispenser of your washing machine. Run a hot water cycle. This is less effective than a soak but more convenient for regular maintenance.
- Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is another effective natural whitener. Add 1/2 cup to your wash cycle along with regular detergent. It boosts cleaning power and brightens whites through alkaline action rather than oxidation.
