## Steps

1. Measure 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
2. Pour it into the fabric softener dispenser of your washing machine. If your machine does not have a dispenser, add the vinegar at the start of the rinse cycle.
3. Run the wash cycle as normal. The vinegar scent dissipates completely as clothes dry.

## Why It Works

Vinegar is a mild acid (acetic acid) that dissolves alkaline detergent residue and mineral deposits left behind in fabric fibers. Removing this buildup restores the natural softness of the fibers and helps towels regain their absorbency. Unlike commercial fabric softeners, vinegar leaves no waxy coating that reduces breathability.

## Alternative

Toss 3-4 wool dryer balls into the dryer with your laundry. They physically separate and fluff fabric as they tumble, reducing static and drying time. Add a few drops of essential oil to the balls for a light scent.

## Tips

- Use plain white distilled vinegar, not apple cider vinegar, to avoid any risk of discoloration.
- Vinegar is safe for all fabric types and colors, including activewear and towels.
- If you prefer a light scent, add 5 drops of essential oil (lavender, lemon, or eucalyptus) to the vinegar before pouring it in.
