## Steps

1. Bring 6 cups of water to a near-boil, then remove from heat.
2. Add 1/2 cup of washing soda to the hot water and stir until fully dissolved.
3. Stir in 1 cup of liquid castile soap until evenly combined.
4. Let the mixture cool to room temperature.
5. Pour into a clean half-gallon jar or bottle and seal.
6. Use 2 tablespoons per load of laundry. Shake gently before each use.

## Why It Works

Washing soda raises wash water pH, breaking down greasy and oily stains. Castile soap lifts dirt and suspends it in water so it rinses away cleanly. Together they handle everyday grime without synthetic surfactants.

## Alternative

Place 4-5 dried soap nuts in a small cloth bag and toss it into the drum with your laundry. Soap nuts release saponin, a natural surfactant, when agitated in water. Reuse the same bag for 5-6 loads before composting the shells.

## Tips

- Store at room temperature. If the mixture thickens or separates over time, shake well or add a splash of warm water.
- For extra freshness, add 10-15 drops of lavender or tea tree essential oil when mixing.
- Works best in warm or hot water cycles; for cold water loads, dissolve the detergent in a cup of warm water before adding to the machine.
