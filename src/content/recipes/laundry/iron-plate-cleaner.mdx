## Steps

1. Make sure the iron is unplugged and completely cool to the touch.
2. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of fine salt, and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. Stir until a thick paste forms.
3. Apply the paste to the soleplate with a soft cloth, spreading it evenly over the entire surface. Focus on areas with visible scorch marks or dark buildup.
4. Gently rub the paste across the soleplate in circular motions using moderate pressure. The salt provides fine abrasion while the baking soda lifts residue. Spend extra time on stubborn spots.
5. Dip a cotton swab in distilled water and carefully clean each steam vent hole on the soleplate. Mineral deposits and starch buildup clog these vents and reduce steam output.
6. Wipe the soleplate clean with a damp cloth, then dry immediately with a clean towel.
7. Plug in the iron, set it to the steam setting, and iron over an old towel for 1 minute. This flushes any remaining residue from the steam vents.

## Why It Works

Iron soleplates accumulate burnt-on starch residue, synthetic fabric melts, and mineral scale from tap water used in the steam reservoir. Baking soda is an alkaline cleaner (pH 8.3) that dissolves acidic starch residue and acts as a gentle abrasive softer than the stainless steel soleplate. Fine salt provides additional mechanical scrubbing action at a controlled hardness — it is hard enough to remove scorch deposits but too soft to scratch polished metal. Vinegar dissolves calcium and mineral deposits from hard water that clog steam vents. The combination cleans all three types of soleplate contamination in a single treatment.

## Tips

- For non-stick coated soleplates, skip the salt and use baking soda alone with water. Salt can scratch delicate non-stick coatings.
- To prevent future buildup, always empty the water reservoir after each use. Standing water deposits minerals as it evaporates.
- Use distilled water in your iron's steam reservoir instead of tap water. This eliminates mineral scale entirely.
- If your iron is dragging on fabric, the soleplate needs cleaning. Residue creates friction that pulls and distorts fabric.
- For extreme scorch marks, iron over a sheet of aluminum foil sprinkled with salt. The heat softens the residue while the salt abrades it off.
