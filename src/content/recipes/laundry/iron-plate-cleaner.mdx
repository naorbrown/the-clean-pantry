## Steps

1. Unplug the iron and let it cool completely.
2. Mix 2 tablespoons of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of fine salt, and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar into a thick paste.
3. Spread the paste evenly over the soleplate, focusing on scorch marks and dark buildup.
4. Rub in circular motions with moderate pressure. Spend extra time on stubborn spots.
5. Clean each steam vent hole with a cotton swab dipped in distilled water.
6. Wipe clean with a damp cloth, then dry immediately.
7. Plug in, set to steam, and iron over an old towel for 1 minute to flush the vents.

## Why It Works

Baking soda dissolves acidic starch residue and acts as a gentle abrasive softer than stainless steel. Fine salt scrubs away scorch deposits without scratching polished metal. Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits from hard water that clog steam vents. The combination addresses all three types of soleplate contamination in one treatment.

## Tips

- For non-stick soleplates, skip the salt and use baking soda alone with water.
- Empty the water reservoir after each use to prevent mineral deposits.
- Use distilled water instead of tap water to eliminate scale entirely.
- For extreme scorch marks, iron over aluminum foil sprinkled with salt.
