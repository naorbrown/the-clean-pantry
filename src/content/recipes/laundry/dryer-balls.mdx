## Steps

1. **Wind the yarn:** Wrap yarn around two fingers about 10 times. Slide off and wrap around the middle to form a bow shape. Continue wrapping in all directions to form a tight ball about 3 inches in diameter.
2. Repeat to make 3 balls total, each using roughly 60 to 70 yards of yarn.
3. **Prepare for felting:** Place each ball inside a pantyhose leg, tying cotton string between each ball to separate and compress them.
4. **Felt the balls:** Run the pantyhose bundle through a hot wash cycle with a cold rinse.
5. Transfer directly to the dryer and run a full high-heat cycle.
6. Repeat wash-and-dry 2 to 3 more times until the balls are firm and you cannot pull individual yarn strands free.
7. Cut the pantyhose away. Toss all 3 into the dryer with each load.

## Why It Works

Wool balls physically separate fabric layers, creating air channels that reduce drying time by 10 to 25 percent. The wool absorbs and releases moisture as it tumbles, moderating drum humidity and reducing static. Felting locks fibers together so the balls hold their shape through hundreds of cycles without shedding.

## Alternative

- If you do not want to make your own, look for pre-made 100% New Zealand wool dryer balls at natural grocery stores or online. They are typically sold in sets of 3 or 6.
- In a pinch, tightly rolled aluminum foil balls (about 3 inches in diameter) can reduce static, though they do not soften fabric or reduce drying time the way wool does.
## Tips

- Use 3 balls for small to medium loads and 6 for large loads.
- They last about 1,000 loads. When they look ragged or break apart, compost them.
- For a light scent, add 2 to 3 drops of essential oil to each ball before tossing in the dryer.
- If static persists, shorten drying time — over-drying is the primary cause of static cling.
