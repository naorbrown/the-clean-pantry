## Steps

1. **Wind the yarn:** Start by wrapping yarn around two fingers about 10 times. Slide the bundle off your fingers and wrap yarn around the middle to form a small bow shape. Continue wrapping yarn in all directions, forming a tight ball approximately the size of a tennis ball (about 3 inches in diameter).
2. Repeat the winding process to make 3 balls total. Each ball will use roughly 60 to 70 yards of yarn.
3. **Prepare for felting:** Place each wool ball inside a pantyhose leg, tying a tight knot of cotton string between each ball so they are separated and compressed.
4. **Felt the balls:** Place the pantyhose bundle in the washing machine and run it through a hot wash cycle with a cold rinse. The temperature shock causes the wool fibers to matt and lock together.
5. Transfer the bundle directly to the dryer and run a full high-heat cycle.
6. Repeat the wash-and-dry cycle 2 to 3 more times until the balls are firm and dense. You should not be able to pull individual yarn strands free from the surface.
7. Cut the pantyhose away and your dryer balls are ready to use. Toss all 3 into the dryer with each load.

## Why It Works

Wool dryer balls work through two mechanisms. First, they physically separate layers of fabric as they tumble, creating air channels between items. This allows hot air to circulate more evenly, reducing drying time by 10 to 25 percent. Second, the wool fibers absorb moisture from the laundry and then release it as they bounce around, which moderates humidity inside the drum and reduces static electricity. The felting process is essential — it locks the fibers together so the ball maintains its shape through hundreds of dryer cycles and does not shed loose fibers onto clothing.

## Tips

- Use 3 balls for small to medium loads and 6 for large loads. More balls means more agitation and faster drying.
- Wool dryer balls last for approximately 1,000 loads before they start to lose density and effectiveness. When they begin to look ragged or break apart, compost them.
- For a light scent, add 2 to 3 drops of essential oil (lavender, lemon, or eucalyptus) to each ball before tossing them in the dryer. The scent is subtle and fades after a few loads, so reapply as desired.
- Store the dryer balls in the dryer between loads. They do not need any special storage.
- If your dryer balls are not reducing static effectively, try shortening your drying time. Over-drying is the primary cause of static cling, and dryer balls shorten the necessary cycle length.

## Alternative

- If you do not want to make your own, look for pre-made 100% New Zealand wool dryer balls at natural grocery stores or online. They are typically sold in sets of 3 or 6.
- In a pinch, tightly rolled aluminum foil balls (about 3 inches in diameter) can reduce static, though they do not soften fabric or reduce drying time the way wool does.
