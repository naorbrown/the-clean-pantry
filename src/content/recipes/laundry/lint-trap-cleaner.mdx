## Steps

1. Remove the lint screen from the dryer and peel off all visible lint by hand or with a vacuum crevice tool.
2. Hold the screen under a faucet and run hot water over it. If water pools on the screen instead of passing through freely, the mesh is coated with invisible dryer sheet residue and needs deep cleaning.
3. Fill a sink or basin with hot water. Add 1 tablespoon of dish soap, 2 tablespoons of baking soda, and 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
4. Submerge the lint screen in the solution and let it soak for 15 minutes. The soap and baking soda will dissolve the waxy fabric softener film.
5. After soaking, scrub both sides of the screen gently with a soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush. You will see a soapy residue lift off the mesh.
6. Rinse the screen thoroughly under hot running water until water flows freely through every section of the mesh.
7. Shake off excess water and let the screen air dry completely before reinserting it into the dryer. A damp screen can attract lint more quickly.

## Why It Works

Dryer sheets and liquid fabric softeners deposit a thin waxy coating on the lint trap mesh with every cycle. This invisible film gradually blocks airflow through the screen, even when no visible lint is present. Reduced airflow forces the dryer to work harder, increases drying time, raises energy costs, and significantly increases fire risk. Dish soap is a surfactant specifically designed to dissolve waxy, oily residues — it breaks down the fabric softener film at the molecular level. Baking soda boosts the cleaning power with mild alkalinity and gentle abrasion on the fine mesh. Vinegar dissolves any mineral deposits from hard water that may also be contributing to airflow blockage.

## Tips

- Perform this deep clean every 3 months, or monthly if you use dryer sheets with every load.
- The water test is the simplest way to check if your lint screen needs deep cleaning. If water beads up and sits on the mesh rather than flowing through, the screen is coated.
- Consider switching from dryer sheets to wool dryer balls. They soften clothes without depositing waxy residue on the lint screen.
- While the screen soaks, use a vacuum with a long crevice attachment to clean inside the lint trap housing in the dryer. Lint accumulates in this cavity and is a primary cause of dryer fires.
- A clean lint trap can reduce drying time by up to 30%, which saves noticeable energy costs over a year.
