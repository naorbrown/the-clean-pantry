## Steps

1. Remove the lint screen and peel off all visible lint by hand or with a vacuum crevice tool.
2. Run hot water over the screen. If water pools instead of passing through, the mesh is coated and needs deep cleaning.
3. Fill a sink with hot water. Add 1 tablespoon of dish soap, 2 tablespoons of baking soda, and 1/4 cup of white vinegar.
4. Submerge the lint screen and soak for 15 minutes.
5. Scrub both sides gently with a soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush.
6. Rinse under hot running water until water flows freely through every section.
7. Air dry completely before reinserting into the dryer.

## Why It Works

Dryer sheets deposit a thin waxy film on the lint trap mesh each cycle, gradually blocking airflow and increasing fire risk. Dish soap dissolves the waxy residue. Baking soda adds mild alkalinity and gentle abrasion. Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits that also contribute to blockage.

## Tips

- Deep clean every 3 months, or monthly if you use dryer sheets with every load.
- Consider switching to wool dryer balls — they soften clothes without depositing waxy residue.
- While the screen soaks, vacuum inside the lint trap housing with a crevice attachment.
- A clean lint trap can reduce drying time by up to 30%.
