## Steps

1. Remove any clothes from the washing machine. Pull out the detergent dispenser tray and soak it in a sink of hot water and 1 tablespoon of vinegar while you clean the machine.
2. For front-loading machines: dip a cloth in hydrogen peroxide and wipe the rubber door gasket thoroughly, pulling it back to clean inside the folds where mold accumulates. For top-loaders, skip this step.
3. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of baking soda directly into the drum.
4. Set the machine to the hottest water setting and the longest cycle available. Many machines have a dedicated "clean" cycle — use it if available.
5. Start the cycle. Once the drum has filled with water, pause the machine and add 2 cups of white vinegar directly to the water. Let it agitate for 1 minute to mix, then pause again and let the solution soak for 30 minutes.
6. Resume the cycle and let it complete fully, including the spin and drain.
7. After the cycle ends, wipe the inside of the drum, the door seal, and the door itself with a dry cloth. Leave the door open to air dry.

## Why It Works

Washing machines develop odor and mildew because they are constantly damp environments where detergent residue, fabric softener buildup, and body soil accumulate in areas the wash water does not fully reach. Baking soda is a mild alkaline abrasive that scrubs the drum interior and neutralizes acidic odor compounds. Hot water dissolves and flushes away accumulated soap scum and fabric softener wax. Vinegar's acetic acid kills mold and mildew on contact and dissolves mineral scale from hard water that builds up inside hoses and the pump. Hydrogen peroxide is specifically effective against the black mold (Cladosporium) that grows in front-loader gasket folds.

## Tips

- Run this cleaning cycle once a month to prevent odor buildup and keep the machine fresh.
- After every wash load, leave the door or lid open for at least an hour to let moisture evaporate. This single habit prevents the majority of washing machine odor problems.
- Front-loader gaskets are the most common source of washing machine mold. Wipe the gasket dry after every use.
- Use only the recommended amount of detergent. Excess detergent does not rinse away fully and feeds mold and bacteria inside the machine.
- Scrub the detergent dispenser tray with an old toothbrush to remove the slimy biofilm that accumulates there.
