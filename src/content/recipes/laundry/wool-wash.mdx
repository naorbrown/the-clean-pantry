## Steps

1. Fill a clean basin or sink with cool water (around 70-80 degrees F / 21-27 degrees C). The water should feel slightly cool to the touch, never warm.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap and swirl gently with your hand until dissolved. Do not create excessive suds.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of glycerin and stir to combine. If using lanolin, add 1/4 teaspoon now.
4. Submerge the garment and gently press it down into the water. Push the water through the fabric with a slow kneading motion. Do not rub, twist, or scrub.
5. Soak for 10-15 minutes, gently agitating once or twice during the soak.
6. Drain the soapy water. Fill the basin with fresh cool water at the same temperature and gently press the garment to rinse. Repeat the rinse until the water runs clear and soap-free.
7. Lift the garment out of the water supporting its full weight -- do not let it stretch under its own wet weight. Lay it flat on a clean, dry towel.
8. Roll the towel with the garment inside to press out excess water. Unroll and reshape the garment on a fresh dry towel or a mesh drying rack. Lay flat to dry away from direct heat or sunlight.

## Why It Works

Wool fibers are coated with tiny overlapping scales. Heat and agitation cause these scales to interlock permanently -- that is felting. Castile soap is gentle enough to clean wool without stripping its natural lanolin coating or raising the fiber scales aggressively. The glycerin adds a softening effect that keeps fibers pliable, and the optional lanolin replenishes the natural oil that wool produces, maintaining the fiber's water resistance and softness.

Commercial wool detergents work on the same principle (neutral pH, minimal surfactant) but often include synthetic fragrances and preservatives. This recipe achieves the same cleaning performance with ingredients you can verify.

## Alternative

For a no-soap approach, add 1/4 cup of white vinegar to a basin of cool water and soak the garment for 10 minutes. Vinegar gently cleans and deodorizes wool without any surfactant. Rinse in plain cool water afterward. The vinegar smell disappears completely as the garment dries. This method is especially good for freshening wool sweaters between deeper washes.
## Tips

- Always wash wool in water the same temperature as the rinse water. Sudden temperature changes between wash and rinse cause shock felting.
- If a garment has a specific stain, dab it gently with a small amount of undiluted castile soap before submerging. Do not scrub.
- Cashmere, merino, alpaca, and angora can all be washed with this recipe. Silk also responds well to it, though silk should soak for only 3-5 minutes.
- Reshape knit garments while still damp -- pull sleeves to the correct length, straighten hems, and smooth out the body. The garment will dry in whatever shape you set.
- Store the concentrate in a glass jar at room temperature. It keeps for several months.
