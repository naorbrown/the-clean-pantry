## Steps

1. Fill a basin with cool water (70-80 degrees F). Never warm.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of castile soap and swirl until dissolved.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of glycerin. If using lanolin, add 1/4 teaspoon now.
4. Submerge the garment and push water through it with a slow kneading motion. Do not rub, twist, or scrub.
5. Soak 10-15 minutes, agitating gently once or twice.
6. Drain. Rinse in fresh cool water at the same temperature. Repeat until water runs clear.
7. Lift the garment supporting its full weight. Lay flat on a clean, dry towel.
8. Roll the towel to press out water. Reshape on a fresh towel or mesh rack and lay flat to dry.

## Why It Works

Wool fibers have overlapping scales that interlock permanently under heat and agitation (felting). Castile soap cleans without stripping natural lanolin or raising fiber scales. Glycerin keeps fibers pliable. Optional lanolin replenishes wool's natural oil, maintaining water resistance and softness.

## Alternative

For a no-soap approach, add 1/4 cup of white vinegar to a basin of cool water and soak the garment for 10 minutes. Vinegar gently cleans and deodorizes wool without any surfactant. Rinse in plain cool water afterward. The vinegar smell disappears completely as the garment dries. This method is especially good for freshening wool sweaters between deeper washes.
## Tips

- Keep wash and rinse water the same temperature to avoid shock felting.
- For stains, dab undiluted castile soap on the spot before submerging. Do not scrub.
- Silk works too, but soak only 3-5 minutes.
- Reshape knit garments while damp — they dry in whatever shape you set.
- Store concentrate in a glass jar at room temperature for several months.
