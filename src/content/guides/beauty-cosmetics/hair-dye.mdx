## What Is in Conventional Hair Dye

Permanent dyes open the hair cuticle with ammonia, then deposit synthetic color using hydrogen peroxide. The colorants are typically coal tar derivatives -- PPD and related compounds. PPD is one of the most common causes of allergic dermatitis in cosmetics and a potential carcinogen.

Other concerning ingredients include resorcinol (endocrine disruptor), ammonia (respiratory irritant), ethanolamine (ammonia replacement, still irritating), and parabens.

The scalp is highly absorbent, and during dyeing it contacts these chemicals for 20-45 minutes while cuticle-opening agents increase permeability.

## Plant-Based Dye Options

### Henna (Lawsonia inermis)

The most established natural hair dye. Lawsone in henna leaves binds to keratin, creating a permanent reddish-brown that grows out rather than washing out. Henna coats and conditions the shaft without opening the cuticle, so it avoids the structural damage of conventional dyes. Many people find henna makes hair thicker and shinier.

**How to use henna:**

1. Mix henna powder with lemon juice or strong black tea to yogurt consistency.
2. Let paste sit 8-12 hours at room temperature for dye release.
3. Apply to clean, dry hair in sections. Cover with a shower cap.
4. Leave on 2-4 hours. Longer time produces deeper color.
5. Rinse with water only (no shampoo for 24-48 hours).

**Color range:** Copper to deep auburn depending on starting color and time. Cannot lighten hair.

**Important:** Only use "body art quality" (BAQ) henna -- 100% Lawsonia inermis powder with no additives. "Black henna" or "neutral henna" often contain PPD. True henna is always a greenish-brown powder that produces reddish tones.

### Indigo (Indigofera tinctoria)

Used with henna to achieve brown to black shades. Applied over a fresh henna base, indigo combines with the red-orange to create browns and near-blacks. The two-step process (henna first, then indigo) is how natural dye reaches dark shades.

### Cassia (Cassia obovata)

Conditions hair and adds golden highlights to light hair without coloring darker hair. Good for conditioning benefits without dramatic color change.

### Other Plant Dyes

- **Chamomile tea rinses** brighten blonde and light brown hair
- **Black walnut hull** produces brown (simmer, strain, use as rinse)
- **Coffee and black tea rinses** temporarily darken by a shade or two
- **Beetroot juice** gives temporary reddish-pink on light hair

Subtle and temporary compared to henna, but completely non-toxic.

## "Natural" Box Dyes

- **Ammonia-free does not mean chemical-free.** Most replace ammonia with ethanolamine, which still opens the cuticle and irritates.
- **"Plant-based" commercial dyes** often contain small amounts of plant colorants alongside synthetic dyes and peroxide. Read the full ingredient list.
- **Demi-permanent dyes** are a legitimate middle ground. They deposit color without fully opening the cuticle and fade over 20-28 washes.

## Practical Considerations

### What Plant Dyes Can and Cannot Do

- **Darken hair:** Yes. Henna plus indigo reaches near-black.
- **Lighten hair:** No. Lightening requires bleach or peroxide.
- **Cover gray:** Yes, but gray strands pick up color brighter and more copper, creating natural variation.
- **Fashion colors (blue, green, purple):** No. These require synthetic pigments.

### Patch Testing

Always patch test any hair dye 48 hours before full application. Apply a small amount to the inside of your elbow and a test strand. Even plant-based products can cause reactions.

### Transitioning from Conventional Dye

Let your chemical dye grow out or fade before applying henna. Henna over recently treated hair produces unpredictable results because the damaged cuticle absorbs plant dye unevenly. Wait at least 6 weeks after your last chemical treatment.
