## Why Cosmetic Ingredients Deserve Scrutiny

The average person uses multiple cosmetic products daily, each containing dozens of chemical ingredients. Cumulative daily exposure over years is the real concern, not a single application.

## Ingredients to Avoid

### Parabens (Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben)

Synthetic preservatives found in foundations, moisturizers, lipsticks, and eye makeup. They mimic estrogen and have been detected in human breast tissue. The concern is cumulative exposure from multiple products used simultaneously every day. Look for any word ending in "-paraben."

### Phthalates (DBP, DEHP, DEP)

Plasticizers that make cosmetics pliable and help fragrance adhere to skin. They are endocrine disruptors linked to reproductive harm. Phthalates are often hidden under "fragrance" or "parfum" on labels, since fragrance formulas do not require individual ingredient disclosure.

### Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde Releasers

A known human carcinogen used as a preservative in nail polish, hair treatments, and some liquid cosmetics. Even when formaldehyde itself is not listed, DMDM hydantoin, quaternium-15, diazolidinyl urea, and bronopol slowly release it over time.

### Lead and Heavy Metals

Lead appears in lipsticks and color cosmetics as a contaminant in pigments. The FDA has found detectable lead in the majority of lipsticks tested. Lipstick is ingested in small amounts throughout the day, creating a direct exposure route. Cadmium, chromium, and arsenic also appear as contaminants.

### Synthetic Fragrances

"Fragrance" on a label can represent hundreds of undisclosed chemicals. Many are skin sensitizers or suspected endocrine disruptors. If a product lists "fragrance" or "parfum" without specifying the source, there is no way to know what is included.

### PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)

"Forever chemicals" found in foundations, concealers, and waterproof cosmetics for water resistance and smooth application. They do not break down in the body or environment. Independent testing has detected PFAS in products marketed as "clean" or "natural."

## How to Read Cosmetic Labels

- **Ingredients are listed by concentration.** The first few make up the bulk of the product.
- **"Fragrance" is a black box.** Choose products that name their scent sources or are fragrance-free.
- **"Natural" and "clean" are unregulated terms.** Any product can use them regardless of ingredients.
- **Look for third-party certifications.** EWG Verified, COSMOS Organic, and USDA Organic have real standards.

## Finding Safer Products

1. **Use the EWG Skin Deep database** (ewg.org/skindeep) to check hazard ratings for specific products.
2. **Choose short ingredient lists.** Fewer ingredients means fewer unknowns.
3. **Prioritize longest-contact products.** Foundation, moisturizer, and lip products come first.
4. **Read the actual ingredient list,** not the front of the package.

## A Realistic Approach

Start with the products you use most frequently and that have the longest skin contact. Replace them as current products run out. Your overall exposure decreases meaningfully without a costly one-time overhaul.
