Once you invest in natural fiber clothing and textiles, taking care of them properly extends their life and avoids re-introducing the chemicals you were trying to avoid in the first place. Most conventional laundry products — detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets — contain synthetic fragrances, optical brighteners, and other additives that coat fibers and build up over time. A simpler approach works better and costs less.

## Washing Basics

### Cold Water Is Almost Always Better

Cold water washing should be your default for nearly everything:

- Prevents shrinkage in cotton and wool
- Preserves color in dyed fabrics
- Uses significantly less energy
- Is gentler on fibers, extending garment life
- Works just as well for everyday laundry — modern detergents are formulated for cold water

Hot water is only necessary for sanitizing (bedding during illness, cloth diapers) or removing oily stains. Warm water is a reasonable middle ground for heavily soiled work clothes.

### Castile Soap as Detergent

Liquid castile soap (like Dr. Bronner's) works well as a laundry detergent alternative:

- Use 1/3 to 1/2 cup per full load
- It is a true soap (made from plant oils) rather than a synthetic detergent
- No synthetic fragrances, optical brighteners, or petroleum-derived surfactants
- Works best in soft water — in hard water, soap can leave residue
- For hard water areas, add 1/4 cup washing soda to the load to soften the water and boost cleaning

Other good options include soap nuts (the dried fruit of the Sapindus tree, which contains natural saponins) and unscented, plant-based detergents with short ingredient lists.

### White Vinegar as Fabric Softener

White vinegar is the best natural fabric softener:

- Add 1/2 cup to the rinse cycle (use the fabric softener dispenser)
- Dissolves detergent and mineral residue that makes fabric stiff
- Naturally softens fibers without coating them
- Removes odors rather than masking them
- Helps prevent static cling
- The vinegar smell disappears completely once clothes are dry
- Costs a fraction of commercial fabric softeners

Do not use vinegar and castile soap in the same wash cycle — the acid in vinegar reacts with soap, potentially leaving a residue. Add the vinegar only during the rinse cycle, after the soap has been washed out.

## Drying

### Air Drying vs Machine Drying

Air drying is better for your clothes in almost every way:

- Heat from the dryer breaks down fibers over time — that lint in your dryer trap is literally pieces of your clothing
- Natural fibers (cotton, linen, wool) are especially sensitive to heat damage
- Air drying preserves elasticity, color, and fabric integrity
- Hang or lay flat on a drying rack; direct sunlight naturally whitens whites but can fade colors
- Indoor drying racks work well in any season

When you do use a dryer, use the lowest heat setting necessary and remove clothes while still slightly damp. Wool dryer balls (the real ones, made from felted wool) help reduce drying time and static without chemicals. Avoid dryer sheets entirely — they coat fabric with synthetic fragrance and a waxy residue that reduces the absorbency of towels and the breathability of natural fibers.

## Wool Care

Wool requires a bit more attention but rewards you with incredible longevity:

- **Wash infrequently.** Wool is naturally antimicrobial and odor-resistant. Air it out between wears rather than washing after every use.
- **Hand wash or gentle cycle.** Use cool water and a wool-specific soap (like Eucalan or Soak). Regular detergents are too harsh and can strip the lanolin that keeps wool soft and water-resistant.
- **Never wring.** Gently squeeze out excess water or roll the garment in a clean towel and press.
- **Lay flat to dry.** Hanging wet wool stretches it out of shape. Lay it flat on a towel or drying rack and reshape while damp.
- **Avoid heat.** Never put wool in the dryer. Heat causes felting (permanent shrinkage).

## Natural Stain Treatment

Most common stains respond well to simple, natural treatments:

- **Baking soda paste.** Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to form a paste. Apply to the stain, let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then brush off and wash. Works well on grease and oil stains.
- **Hydrogen peroxide (3%).** Dab directly onto the stain for blood, wine, coffee, and tea. Test on an inconspicuous area first — it can lighten colored fabrics. Works best on whites and light colors.
- **Salt.** Pour salt on fresh red wine or blood stains immediately to absorb the liquid before it sets.
- **Lemon juice and sunlight.** Apply lemon juice to the stain and lay the garment in direct sunlight. The combination is a natural bleaching agent for whites.
- **Club soda.** Effective for fresh stains when applied immediately. The carbonation helps lift the stain from fibers.

The most important rule for any stain: treat it as soon as possible. A fresh stain is always easier to remove than a set one. And avoid putting a stained garment in the dryer — heat sets most stains permanently.

## Moth Prevention

If you own wool clothing or blankets, moths are a real concern. Chemical mothballs (naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene) are effective but toxic — both compounds are classified as possible carcinogens and the smell permeates everything.

Natural alternatives that work:

- **Cedar.** Cedar wood and cedar oil contain natural compounds that repel moths. Use cedar blocks, rings, or sachets in closets and drawers. Sand the surface periodically to refresh the scent.
- **Lavender.** Dried lavender sachets repel moths and smell pleasant. Replace every 6-12 months as the scent fades.
- **Clean storage.** Moths are attracted to dirty wool (body oils and food residue). Always wash wool before storing it for the season.
- **Sealed storage.** Store off-season wool items in sealed containers or garment bags. Moths cannot eat what they cannot reach.
- **Regular inspection.** Check stored wool items periodically for signs of moth damage (small holes, webbing, larvae).

The combination of clean garments stored in sealed containers with cedar or lavender is effective and avoids the health concerns of chemical moth repellents entirely.
