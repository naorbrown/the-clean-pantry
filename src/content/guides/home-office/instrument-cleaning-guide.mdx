## Why Instrument Cleaning Matters

Instruments are precision objects where finger oils, dust, and corrosion affect both sound and physical integrity. Regular cleaning is preventive maintenance, not cosmetic vanity.

The challenge: instruments combine wildly different materials -- nitrocellulose lacquer, raw rosewood, ivory, rubber, conductive traces, PVC vinyl -- and a cleaner safe for one can destroy another.

## Guitar Care: Finishes, Fretboards, and Strings

### Understanding Guitar Finishes

The wrong cleaner on the wrong finish causes permanent damage. Know your finish first.

| Finish Type | Common On | Safe Cleaners | Avoid |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Polyurethane | Most modern guitars (Yamaha, Taylor, lower-end Fender/Gibson) | Damp microfiber cloth, mild oil-vinegar polish | Abrasive compounds |
| Polyester | Budget to mid-range guitars | Damp microfiber cloth, most commercial polishes | Nothing particular -- polyester is very durable |
| Nitrocellulose lacquer | Vintage and high-end guitars (Gibson Custom Shop, Fender American Vintage, many acoustics over $1,500) | Damp cloth only, naptha for grime, carnauba wax rated for nitro | Alcohol, silicone polish, vinyl/rubber contact (causes finish checking), adhesive tape |
| Satin / Matte | Many modern acoustics, some electric necks | Dry or barely damp cloth only | Any oil or wax polish (creates permanent shiny spots) |
| Shellac / French polish | Classical guitars, some vintage instruments | Barely damp cloth, specialized French polish products | Water, alcohol, any solvent |

Nitrocellulose lacquer is reactive -- it reacts with rubber, adhesive residue, and many solvents. Keep nitro-finished guitars in hardshell cases, use felt-contact stands, and verify any product is nitro-safe before applying.

### Fretboard Wood Types

Unfinished fretboards (rosewood, ebony, pau ferro) need periodic food-grade mineral oil to prevent drying and cracking. Maple fretboards are sealed and should never be oiled.

Rosewood benefits from conditioning every 2-3 string changes. Ebony absorbs less oil. Pau ferro falls in between.

### String Maintenance

Wiping strings after every session takes 15 seconds and can double string life. Sweat corrodes string alloys and finger oils dampen high-frequency vibration.

## Piano Care: Keys, Cabinet, and the Instrument Inside

### Ivory vs. Plastic Keys

Pre-1970s pianos typically have ivory keys; all newer pianos use plastic. Cleaning differs:

| | Ivory Keys | Plastic Keys |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| **Cleaner** | Barely damp cloth with mild soap, distilled water only | Damp cloth with mild soap, distilled water |
| **Drying** | Immediate and thorough -- ivory absorbs water | Less urgent but still important |
| **Whitening** | Not possible with cleaning -- yellowing is UV oxidation of keratin | Mild soap removes most discoloration |
| **Never use** | Bleach, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, abrasives | Bleach, solvents, abrasive scrubbers |

Universal rule: wipe front-to-back, never side-to-side. Side-to-side motion pushes moisture between keys, swelling wooden key pins and ruining felt bushings.

### Humidity: The Real Enemy

Humidity is a structural concern, not cosmetic. Below 35% RH, wood shrinks: soundboards crack, glue joints separate, tuning pins loosen. Above 60%, wood swells: keys stick, hammers slow, strings rust. Target 40-55% year-round.

In climates with seasonal humidity swings, a piano humidity control system (Dampp-Chaser) is a better investment than any cleaning product.

### When to Call a Professional

Interior cleaning (strings, hammers, action, soundboard) belongs to a piano technician. The action mechanism has thousands of parts in wood, felt, and leather. Have a technician inspect the interior every 1-2 years during tuning.

## Electronic Instruments: Synths, MIDI Controllers, and DJ Gear

### What Makes Electronics Different

Electronic instruments combine cosmetic surfaces (keys, pads, knobs) with functional electrical contacts (pots, fader tracks, jacks). A cleaner safe for the surface can destroy the electronics underneath.

### Safe Cleaning Approach

50/50 distilled water and 70% isopropyl alcohol works for all external surfaces:

1. **Always unplug first.** No exceptions.
2. **Spray the cloth, never the instrument.** Liquid running into fader slots or potentiometer shafts causes corrosion.
3. **Use cotton swabs around knobs and faders.** These areas collect the most grime and need targeted cleaning.
4. **Clean rubber pads gently.** Rubber and silicone pads (on MPC-style controllers, drum machines, and Ableton Push) are porous and absorb liquid more readily than plastic.

### The Scratchy Knob Problem

A crackling knob is a dirty potentiometer -- dust and oxidation on the carbon track cause intermittent contact. Surface cleaning slows this, but once it starts, use DeoxIT D5 contact cleaner: one drop on the shaft, rotate back and forth 20 times.

### Fader Maintenance

Faders are more vulnerable than knobs -- their slot is a direct dust pathway. Dust makes them gritty and causes audio dropouts. Cover gear when not in use. Fix with compressed air (short bursts, never insert the nozzle) then contact cleaner if needed.

## Brass and Woodwind Instruments

Brass instruments need regular valve oil, slide grease, and periodic cleaning baths. Woodwinds require swabbing after every session plus periodic pad and cork maintenance. Consult manufacturer documentation or a repair technician for these specialized instruments.

## Vinyl Records: Handling, Cleaning, and Storage

### Proper Handling

Handle records by edges and center label only. Never touch the grooved surface. Let gravity slide a record onto your palm when removing from its sleeve.

### Cleaning Technique

Record grooves are V-shaped channels ~40-50 micrometers wide. Any particle produces pops, clicks, or surface noise.

Always wipe following the groove arc (circular, matching spin direction). Never wipe radially -- it pushes debris across groove walls.

### Storage

- Store vertically, never stacked flat (stacking causes warping)
- Use anti-static inner sleeves (HDPE or rice paper) instead of fiber-shedding paper
- Keep away from direct sunlight and heat -- PVC softens at ~140F
- Maintain 40-60% humidity to prevent mold on sleeves

### Cleaning Frequency

Clean when surface noise increases, after buying used records, and before playing long-stored records. Properly handled records in anti-static sleeves go months between cleanings.

## Products to Avoid on All Instruments

Common household products that damage instruments:

| Product | Why It Is Dangerous |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Silicone spray / Pledge / Endust** | Silicone penetrates wood finishes and becomes impossible to remove. It interferes with future refinishing, causes clouding, and builds up into a gummy layer. |
| **Windex / glass cleaner** | Contains ammonia that strips coatings, damages lacquer finishes, and leaves residue on electronics. |
| **Bleach wipes (Clorox, Lysol)** | Contains sodium hypochlorite and quaternary ammonium compounds that corrode metal, degrade rubber, and damage plastic and wood finishes. |
| **Paper towels** | Abrasive wood fibers scratch glossy finishes and delicate surfaces. Always use microfiber or lint-free cotton cloths. |
| **Furniture oil (Old English, etc.)** | Contains petroleum distillates and silicone. Despite marketing claims, these products damage instrument finishes over time. |
| **WD-40** | Not a cleaner and not a lubricant. It is a water displacement spray that leaves a residue, attracts dust, and damages rubber and plastic components. |

## Humidity and Temperature: The Invisible Threat

Wood is hygroscopic -- it absorbs and releases moisture, expanding and contracting with humidity changes. This stresses glue joints, shifts calibrated geometry, and can crack soundboards and necks.

| Factor | Ideal Range |
|--------|------------|
| Relative humidity | 40-55% |
| Temperature | 18-24 degrees Celsius (65-75 degrees Fahrenheit) |
| Temperature change rate | No more than 5 degrees per hour |
| Direct sunlight | None |

Never store in attics, basements, garages, or cars (car interiors exceed 150F in summer). Use a hygrometer. In dry climates, use a room humidifier or instrument-specific humidifier.

Electronic instruments are less sensitive but not immune. High humidity accelerates contact oxidation, and condensation can short-circuit PCBs. Allow electronics to reach room temperature before powering on after cold transport.
