## Why Electronics Need Cleaning

Dust, skin oils, food particles, and ambient grease coat every screen, cable, and device in your home. Beyond looking dirty, this buildup causes real problems: overheating devices, degraded connections, yellowed cables, and in the case of outlets and power strips, genuine fire risk. A regular cleaning routine extends device lifespan and keeps your space feeling sharp.

## The Golden Rules

Before cleaning any electronic device:

1. **Power off and unplug.** Always. No exceptions.
2. **Spray the cloth, not the device.** Liquid and electronics don't mix.
3. **Use microfiber, not paper towels.** Paper towels scratch screens and leave lint.
4. **Stick to 70% isopropyl alcohol or plain distilled water.** Skip household cleaners — they contain surfactants and fragrances that leave residue or damage coatings.
5. **Let everything dry completely** before plugging back in.

## Screens (TVs, Monitors, Tablets, Phones)

A 50/50 mix of distilled water and a tiny splash of white vinegar handles fingerprints on most screens. For OLED displays, use distilled water only — vinegar's acidity can degrade certain coatings over time. Always wipe in one direction, not circles, to avoid pushing oils around.

## Cables and Wires

Pinch a damp microfiber cloth around the cable and slide end to end. Charging cables collect skin oils from daily handling; ethernet and power cords collect dust. White cables yellow fastest — monthly cleaning prevents permanent discoloration.

## Gaming Consoles and Routers

Focus on vents. A soft-bristle paintbrush sweeps dust out; compressed air in short bursts handles stubborn buildup. Never use a vacuum — static discharge can fry components. Keep devices elevated off carpet and away from walls for better airflow.

## Power Strips and Outlets

Unplug everything first. Brush dust from socket openings with a dry paintbrush or cotton swab. Wipe the exterior with a barely-damp cloth. For wall outlets, turn off the circuit breaker before doing anything — it only takes a minute and eliminates all risk.

## Keyboards and Mice

Turn upside down and gently shake out debris. Use compressed air between keys. Wipe keycaps and the mouse surface with an alcohol-dampened cloth. For deep cleans, you can pop keycaps off most mechanical keyboards and soak them in warm soapy water.

## How Often

| Device | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Phone/tablet screen | Weekly |
| Computer monitor | Every 2 weeks |
| Keyboard and mouse | Weekly |
| Cables | Monthly |
| Gaming consoles | Every 2–3 months |
| Power strips | Every 2–3 months |
| Wall outlets | Every 3–6 months |

## What to Avoid

- **Glass cleaner (Windex)** — contains ammonia that damages screen coatings
- **Bleach or hydrogen peroxide** — too harsh for plastic casings and screens
- **Paper towels or tissues** — scratch screens, leave fibers everywhere
- **Compressed air held too close** — can force dust deeper into vents
- **Vacuums near circuit boards** — static discharge risk

Keep it simple: distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, microfiber cloths, cotton swabs, and a soft brush handle 95% of electronics cleaning. The same pantry-simple philosophy that works for your kitchen works for your tech.
