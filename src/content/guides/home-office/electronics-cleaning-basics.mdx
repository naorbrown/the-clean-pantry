## Why Electronics Need Cleaning

Dust, skin oils, food particles, and grease coat every screen, cable, and device. This buildup causes overheating, degraded connections, yellowed cables, and in the case of outlets and power strips, fire risk. Regular cleaning extends device lifespan.

## The Golden Rules


1. **Power off and unplug.** Always. No exceptions.
2. **Spray the cloth, not the device.** Liquid and electronics don't mix.
3. **Use microfiber, not paper towels.** Paper towels scratch screens and leave lint.
4. **Stick to 70% isopropyl alcohol or plain distilled water.** Skip household cleaners — they contain surfactants and fragrances that leave residue or damage coatings.
5. **Let everything dry completely** before plugging back in.

## Screens (TVs, Monitors, Tablets, Phones)

A 50/50 mix of distilled water and a tiny splash of white vinegar handles fingerprints on most screens. For OLED displays, use distilled water only — vinegar's acidity can degrade certain coatings over time. Always wipe in one direction, not circles, to avoid pushing oils around.

## Cables and Wires

Pinch a damp microfiber cloth around the cable and slide end to end. White cables yellow fastest — monthly cleaning prevents permanent discoloration.

## Gaming Consoles and Routers

Focus on vents. Soft-bristle paintbrush sweeps dust out; compressed air in short bursts handles stubborn buildup. Never use a vacuum — static discharge can fry components. Keep devices elevated off carpet and away from walls.

## Power Strips and Outlets

Unplug everything first. Brush dust from socket openings with a dry paintbrush or cotton swab. Wipe exterior with a barely-damp cloth. For wall outlets, turn off the circuit breaker first.

## Keyboards and Mice

Turn upside down and shake out debris. Compressed air between keys. Wipe keycaps and mouse with an alcohol-dampened cloth. For deep cleans, pop keycaps off mechanical keyboards and soak in warm soapy water.

## How Often

| Device | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Phone/tablet screen | Weekly |
| Computer monitor | Every 2 weeks |
| Keyboard and mouse | Weekly |
| Cables | Monthly |
| Gaming consoles | Every 2–3 months |
| Power strips | Every 2–3 months |
| Wall outlets | Every 3–6 months |

## What to Avoid

- **Glass cleaner (Windex)** — contains ammonia that damages screen coatings
- **Bleach or hydrogen peroxide** — too harsh for plastics and screens
- **Paper towels or tissues** — scratch screens, leave fibers
- **Compressed air held too close** — forces dust deeper into vents
- **Vacuums near circuit boards** — static discharge risk

Distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, microfiber cloths, cotton swabs, and a soft brush handle 95% of electronics cleaning.
