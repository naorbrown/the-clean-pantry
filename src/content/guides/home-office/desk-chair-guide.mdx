## Why Office Furniture Collects Contaminants

Desks and chairs accumulate skin cells, body oils, sweat, food particles, and dust. These feed dust mites and bacteria. An office chair absorbs body heat and moisture throughout the day, creating conditions where microorganisms thrive in seat cushions and armrest padding.

Office furniture is also a source of chemical off-gassing. Particleboard desks emit formaldehyde. Foam cushions release flame retardants. Synthetic mesh can outgas VOCs for months. Cleaning with commercial sprays containing quats, ammonia, or synthetic fragrances adds another chemical layer to a space where you spend most of your day.

## Desk Cleaning by Surface Type

**Laminate and melamine:** Equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle, applied to a microfiber cloth. For sticky spots, baking soda paste for 5 minutes, then wipe. Avoid abrasive scrubbers -- laminate scratches become permanent dirt traps.

**Solid wood:** Damp microfiber cloth in plain warm water. For deeper cleaning, 1 tsp castile soap in 2 cups warm water. Wipe with the grain, dry immediately. Condition every 3-6 months with beeswax and olive oil (4:1 ratio).

**Standing desk frames and metal:** Vinegar-water cloth, dry thoroughly to prevent rust. Never spray liquid into motors or electronic controls.

## Chair Cleaning by Material

**Mesh chairs:** Vacuum with upholstery attachment. Wipe both sides with vinegar-water cloth. For odor, sprinkle baking soda, wait 20 minutes, vacuum.

**Fabric upholstered:** Vacuum first. Spot clean with baking soda paste and soft brush. For overall refresh, spray lightly with 1 cup water, 2 tbsp vinegar, 1 tsp castile soap. Blot (do not rub). Air dry completely.

**Faux leather and vinyl:** Warm soapy water (castile soap). Dry immediately. Condition monthly with coconut or jojoba oil. Avoid silicone protectants -- they create a sticky, dust-attracting film.

**Genuine leather:** pH-neutral leather soap with distilled water. Wring cloth nearly dry. Condition every 3-6 months with beeswax-based conditioner. Never use vinegar on leather -- acidity dries and damages the hide.

## Armrests and High-Touch Areas

Armrests, adjustment levers, and drawer handles accumulate the most bacteria and body oil. Wipe 2-3 times per week with vinegar-water cloth. Pay attention to armrest undersides where oil builds invisibly. For darkened padded armrests, scrub gently with baking soda paste and a soft brush, then blot with a damp cloth.

## Reducing Chemical Exposure

Choose solid wood or low-emission plywood desks over particleboard. Look for GREENGUARD Gold certified chairs. For existing furniture that smells of chemicals, increase ventilation for the first several months and wipe surfaces weekly with vinegar solution to clear surface-level VOC residue.
