## What Printers Emit

**Laser printers** heat toner powder to ~400F to fuse it onto paper, releasing ultrafine particles (UFPs) under 100 nm that penetrate deep into lung tissue. They also emit VOCs (styrene, benzene, toluene) from heated toner and ozone from the corona wire.

**Inkjet printers** produce far fewer airborne particles since they deposit liquid ink at room temperature. Some inks contain glycol ethers and solvents that evaporate during printing, contributing to VOC levels.

## Health Considerations

Some laser printers emit ultrafine particle concentrations comparable to cigarette smoke. These particles bypass respiratory defenses. Short-term exposure can cause eye and throat irritation, headaches, and coughing. People with asthma may notice worsening symptoms.

Toner contains carbon black (IARC Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic) and trace heavy metals depending on color. Greatest risk comes from toner spills and cartridge changes when fine powder becomes airborne.

## Reducing Exposure in a Home Office

- **Place the printer in a separate room or well-ventilated area.** The single most effective step.
- **Ventilate during and after printing.** Open a window or run an exhaust fan. Particle concentrations take 10-20 minutes to return to baseline.
- **Use a HEPA air purifier.** Captures 99.97% of particles at 0.3 microns. Add an activated carbon pre-filter for VOC protection.
- **Choose inkjet over laser if feasible.** Under 100 pages per week, inkjet produces dramatically lower emissions.
- **Replace toner carefully.** Wear gloves. Never blow on spilled toner or use a regular vacuum. Wipe with a damp cloth or HEPA vacuum.

## Maintaining Your Printer Safely

- **Clean exterior monthly** with a cloth dampened with distilled water.
- **Replace the ozone filter** if your laser printer has one. Check manual for schedule.
- **Never use compressed air inside a laser printer.** Disperses fine particles into room air.
- **Batch print jobs.** Reduces heating cycles and total particle emission time.

## Ink and Toner Disposal

Never trash cartridges -- toner powder contaminates soil and groundwater. Most office supply retailers accept empties. Manufacturers offer take-back programs with prepaid labels. For toner spills, scoop with a stiff card into a sealed bag. Never use hot water on toner -- heat fuses it permanently to fabric and surfaces.
