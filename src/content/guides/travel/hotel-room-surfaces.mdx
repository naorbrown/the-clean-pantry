## Why Hotel Rooms Need a Wipe-Down

Housekeeping prioritizes visual cleanliness under tight time pressure (15-30 minutes per room). The dirtiest surfaces are the ones guests touch constantly but get only a quick pass: remotes, switches, faucet handles.

A check-in wipe-down isn't about sterilization -- just reducing pathogens on high-touch surfaces. Takes under 5 minutes.

## High-Touch Surfaces Ranked

Ranked from most to least contaminated:

1. **TV remote.** Buttons and crevices trap residue. Consistently the dirtiest object.
2. **Light switches.** Narrow ridges a quick wipe misses. Bathroom and bedside switches worst.
3. **Door handles.** Touched before and after handwashing -- reliable transfer surfaces.
4. **Faucet handles.** Turned on with dirty hands, off with clean. Never cleaned in between.
5. **Telephone.** Often skipped by housekeeping. Pressed against your face.
6. **Desk surface.** Serves as luggage staging, eating, and workspace.
7. **Nightstand.** Touched repeatedly in the dark throughout your stay.

## Bathroom Priorities

**Toilet flush handle** -- touched before handwashing, small surface often missed. **Faucet handles** -- contacted with unwashed hands. **Countertop** -- collects splashes and whatever guests set down, often only partially wiped. **Shower knobs** -- wet environment encourages bacterial growth.

The **toilet seat** is counterintuitively one of the cleaner surfaces -- housekeeping focuses on it because guests notice.

## Sleep Surfaces

**Pull back the bedspread.** Top covers are washed far less frequently than sheets. Sheets should be crisp, white, stain-free. If questionable, call for fresh linens.

**Check pillows.** Inspect for stains, discoloration, or odor. Request replacements if yellowed or off-smelling.

**Inspect the mattress.** Pull back one corner of the fitted sheet. Check for stains, spots, or pest signs. Takes 10 seconds.

## What You Can Skip

**Floors, curtains, walls, closet interiors** -- all low priority. Minimal hand contact.

Focus on surfaces your hands return to repeatedly: remote, switches, faucet, nightstand.

## The 5-Minute Check-In Routine

1. **Bags on luggage rack, not the bed.** No rack? Use desk or hard chair.
2. **Wipe the TV remote.** Get into button crevices. Highest-impact single action.
3. **Wipe light switches and door handles.** Both sides of entry handle, bathroom handle, all switches. 30 seconds.
4. **Wipe bathroom faucets and countertop.** Include toilet flush handle. Skip toilet seat.
5. **Inspect bedding.** Pull back bedspread, check sheets and pillows for stains/odors.
6. **Open a window or run AC fan.** Clears cleaning fumes and stale air.

Total: under 5 minutes.
