## Why Bring Your Own Cleaning Supplies

Hotels leave industrial cleaning residues on surfaces. Vacation rentals have unpredictable cleaning quality. Planes and rideshares use harsh quaternary ammonium wipes. A travel cleaning kit lets you control what touches your surfaces -- minimal space, no guesswork.

## The Essential Travel Cleaning Kit

Fits in a quart bag, weighs almost nothing:

- **2 oz spray bottle** with vinegar, water, and tea tree oil. TSA-compliant, lasts a week.
- **4-6 pre-soaked wipes in a ziplock.** Damp cloth wipes for planes, rideshares, quick hotel passes.
- **2 microfiber cloths.** One wet, one dry. Works with just water if spray runs out.
- **1-2 oz castile soap concentrate.** All-purpose for rental kitchens, hand-washing, body wash.
- **2 deodorizer sachets.** Baking soda + lavender/eucalyptus oil in muslin bags.
- **1 pair nitrile gloves.** For rental kitchen scrubbing or questionable surfaces.

## Packing for Carry-On vs. Checked

**Carry-on:** 2 oz spray and 1-2 oz castile soap fit TSA 3-1-1 rules. Pre-soaked wipes are not classified as liquids -- best trick for carry-on cleaning. Baking soda sachets pass as dry powder.

**Checked:** Full-sized bottles, extra wipes, no restrictions. Pack liquids in sealed bags.

**International:** EU follows similar rules (100 ml, 1-liter bag). Australia and New Zealand restrict some essential oils -- check before packing.

## Hotel Room Cleaning Routine

1. **High-touch surfaces.** Remote, light switches, door handle.
2. **Bathroom fixtures.** Faucet handles, flush lever, countertop.
3. **Bedside table and desk.** Nightstand, alarm clock, desk surface.
4. **Phone and alarm clock.** Rarely cleaned thoroughly.
5. **Ventilate.** Open window or run AC fan for 10 minutes.

## Airbnb vs. Hotel Priorities

**Hotels:** Standardized cleaning with industrial chemicals. Priority: displace chemical residues on high-touch surfaces. Linens are laundered between guests.

**Airbnbs:** Variable quality. Priority: verification. Check countertops, cookware, under-sink for mold, shower for mildew. Inspect mattress corners.

Bring castile soap for rental kitchens. Wash cutting boards and prep surfaces yourself.

## Maintaining Your Kit

Restock after each trip:

- **Fresh spray solution.** Vinegar loses potency -- mix new, don't top off.
- **Wash and fully dry microfiber cloths.** Damp storage breeds bacteria. No fabric softener.
- **Replace sachets every 3-4 weeks.** Saturated baking soda stops working.
- **Make wipes the day before departure.** They dry out even in sealed bags.
- **Check gloves** for tears or brittleness from heat.

Keep the kit packed between trips.
