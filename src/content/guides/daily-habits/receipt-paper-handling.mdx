## What Is on Your Receipt Paper

The slick, shiny receipts you get from most retail stores, gas stations, ATMs, and restaurants are printed on thermal paper. Unlike regular paper that uses ink, thermal paper is coated with a chemical developer that changes color when heated by the printer head. The most common chemical used in this coating is BPA (bisphenol A), an endocrine-disrupting compound.

BPA is used in thermal paper at remarkably high concentrations -- typically 1-2% of the paper weight. To put this in perspective, the BPA in a single receipt is roughly 250 to 1,000 times greater than the BPA that might leach from a polycarbonate water bottle.

As regulatory pressure has pushed some companies away from BPA, many have switched to BPS (bisphenol S) or other bisphenol analogs. Research increasingly suggests that these substitutes have similar endocrine-disrupting properties to BPA. A receipt labeled "BPA-free" is not necessarily safer -- it may simply contain a different bisphenol.

## How BPA Absorbs Through Skin

BPA on thermal paper is not chemically bonded to the paper surface -- it exists as a free powder coating that transfers readily to skin on contact. Studies have shown:

- **Simple touch transfers BPA.** Handling a thermal receipt for as little as 5 seconds transfers measurable amounts of BPA to your fingers.
- **Wet or greasy skin absorbs more.** If your hands have hand sanitizer, lotion, or food grease on them, BPA absorption increases dramatically -- one study found a 100-fold increase in dermal absorption with wet or sanitizer-coated hands. This is particularly relevant for cashiers who use hand sanitizer frequently.
- **The transfer persists.** BPA on your fingers can then transfer to food, your mouth, and other surfaces you touch. Washing with soap and water removes most of it, but the transfer can happen before you get a chance to wash.

## Who Is Most Exposed

Cashiers and retail workers handle hundreds of receipts per shift and have consistently higher urinary BPA levels than the general population. Studies of occupational exposure show measurably elevated BPA levels in workers who handle thermal paper regularly.

For the average person, occasional receipt handling is a relatively small exposure compared to dietary sources of BPA (canned food linings, plastic food containers). However, it is an easy exposure to minimize.

## Which Receipts Contain Bisphenols

Not all receipts are thermal paper, and not all thermal paper contains bisphenols.

**Likely thermal (bisphenol-containing):**
- Most retail store receipts
- Gas station pump receipts
- ATM transaction slips
- Restaurant credit card slips
- Parking garage tickets
- Lottery tickets
- Most airline boarding passes printed at kiosks

**Usually not thermal:**
- Receipts from dot-matrix or inkjet receipt printers (these feel like regular paper, not slick)
- Printed invoices from online orders

**Simple test:** Scratch the printed side of the receipt with a fingernail or coin. If a dark mark appears from the friction, it is thermal paper. Regular ink-printed receipts will not show a mark.

## Practical Steps for Safer Handling

These steps are simple and do not require dramatic lifestyle changes.

### Decline When Possible

- If a cashier asks "do you want your receipt?", say no when you do not need it.
- Many stores now offer email or text receipts as standard options. Digital receipts eliminate the exposure entirely.
- For returns and warranties, photograph the receipt with your phone rather than keeping the paper copy.

### Handle Briefly and Wash After

- When you do take a receipt, fold it and put it away rather than holding it while you walk through the store.
- Wash your hands with soap and water after handling receipts. Plain soap and water is more effective than hand sanitizer for BPA removal -- and hand sanitizer actually increases absorption, as noted above.
- Do not crumple or play with receipts. The more you manipulate the paper, the more BPA transfers.

### Keep Away from Food

- Do not set receipts down on kitchen counters or dining tables.
- Do not place receipts in grocery bags where they can contact food.
- Do not let children handle or play with receipts. Children's skin absorbs chemicals more readily than adult skin, and children are more likely to put their fingers in their mouths.

### Store Separately

- Keep receipts in a dedicated envelope, folder, or section of your wallet rather than loose in your pocket where they contact skin continuously.
- Do not recycle thermal receipts with regular paper. BPA in thermal receipts contaminates recycled paper products. Many recycling programs specifically exclude thermal paper. Throw receipts in the regular trash.

## Perspective

Receipt handling is a small piece of overall BPA exposure for most people. Dietary sources (canned food linings, microwaving food in plastic containers, plastic water bottles) likely contribute more to total body burden.

That said, receipts are one of the easiest exposures to eliminate or reduce. Declining a receipt takes zero effort. Choosing digital receipts when available costs nothing. Washing your hands after handling receipts is basic hygiene you should be doing anyway. These are no-cost, no-effort changes that modestly reduce your daily chemical exposure.
