EPA-regulated tap water can still legally contain dozens of chemicals at levels many health advocates argue are outdated. Filtering your drinking water is one of the most impactful steps you can take.

## What Is in Tap Water

Municipal water commonly contains:

- **Chlorine or chloramine.** Disinfectants. Effective, but unnecessary by the time water reaches your glass.
- **Fluoride.** Added for dental health. To remove it, you need reverse osmosis or a specialized filter -- carbon does not work.
- **Lead.** Leaches from old pipes and fixtures. Harmful at any level, especially for children.
- **PFAS.** Persistent synthetic chemicals from nonstick coatings and firefighting foam. Do not break down; accumulate in the body.
- **Pharmaceuticals and hormones.** Trace medications that pass through wastewater treatment. Long-term effects of chronic low-dose exposure are unknown.
- **Disinfection byproducts (DBPs).** Formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter. Present in virtually all chlorinated water.
- **Microplastics.** Found in tap water worldwide. Health effects still being studied.

## Filter Types

### Pitcher Filters (Brita-Style)

The most basic option.

- **Removes:** Chlorine taste/odor, some heavy metals, some particulates
- **Does not remove:** Fluoride, PFAS, most pharmaceuticals, chloramine
- **Pros:** Cheap, no installation, widely available
- **Cons:** Slow, limited capacity, minimal filter media, frequent replacements

Pitcher filters are a starting point, not a solution.

### Carbon Block Filters

A significant step up. Densely compressed activated carbon.

- **Removes:** Chlorine, VOCs, organic contaminants, some models handle lead and cysts
- **Does not remove:** Fluoride, dissolved minerals, most PFAS, chloramine (needs catalytic carbon)
- **Installation:** Under-sink, countertop, or faucet-mounted
- **Filter life:** 6-12 months
- **Pros:** Good balance of performance, cost, and convenience. No water waste. Retains minerals.
- **Cons:** Does not address fluoride or dissolved solids

Look for NSF/ANSI 42 (taste/odor) and 53 (health contaminants) certifications.

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)

Forces water through a semipermeable membrane that blocks contaminants at the molecular level.

- **Removes:** Virtually everything -- fluoride, lead, PFAS, arsenic, nitrates, bacteria, pharmaceuticals
- **Does not remove:** Some VOCs and gases (most systems include a carbon pre-filter for these)
- **Installation:** Under-sink with dedicated faucet, or countertop
- **Filter life:** Pre-filters every 6-12 months, membrane every 2-3 years
- **Pros:** The most thorough residential filtration available
- **Cons:** Wastes 2-4 gallons per gallon filtered (improving), removes beneficial minerals, requires remineralization, higher cost, slower flow

The standard choice for removing fluoride, PFAS, or dissolved heavy metals.

### Gravity Filters (Berkey-Style)

Gravity filters use no electricity or water pressure. Water passes through filter elements by gravity alone.

- **What they remove:** Bacteria, parasites, chlorine, VOCs, heavy metals, some pharmaceuticals (performance varies by model and filter element)
- **What they do not remove:** Fluoride (without optional fluoride filter elements), dissolved minerals
- **Installation:** None — a freestanding countertop unit
- **Filter life:** Filter elements last thousands of gallons (often years)
- **Pros:** No electricity, no plumbing, no water waste, very long filter life, portable, works during power outages
- **Cons:** Slow (gravity-fed), takes counter space, independent testing has shown variable performance between units, some models have faced regulatory scrutiny

Gravity filters are a strong option for people who rent, want portability, or want filtration that works without infrastructure. Do your research on specific brands and models — third-party testing data is more reliable than manufacturer claims.

## Remineralization After Reverse Osmosis

RO water is very pure, but that means it has also lost beneficial minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Drinking demineralized water long-term can contribute to mineral deficiency, and the water tastes flat.

Options for remineralization:

- **Inline remineralization filter.** Installs after the RO membrane and adds minerals back as water passes through. Most convenient.
- **Mineral drops.** Concentrated trace mineral drops added to each glass or pitcher. Simple and portable.
- **Himalayan salt sole.** A saturated salt solution added in small amounts. Adds sodium and trace minerals. Use sparingly.

Most under-sink RO systems offer an optional remineralization stage. It is worth including.

## Well Water vs Municipal Water

The filtration approach differs depending on your water source.

**Municipal water:**
- Already treated and disinfected — your main concerns are disinfection byproducts, lead from pipes, PFAS, and fluoride (if you want to remove it)
- A quality carbon block filter handles most concerns; add RO if you need fluoride or PFAS removal

**Well water:**
- Untreated — you are responsible for all water quality
- Common issues: bacteria (E. coli, coliform), nitrates (from agricultural runoff), iron, manganese, sulfur (rotten egg smell), hardness, radon, arsenic
- Testing is essential and should be done annually at minimum
- Treatment often requires multiple stages: sediment pre-filter, UV sterilization for bacteria, specific media for iron/manganese, and a final carbon or RO stage

## How to Get Your Water Tested

- **Municipal water:** Your water utility publishes an annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). Request it or find it on their website. This tells you what is in the water as it leaves the treatment plant — but not what it picks up between there and your tap.
- **Tap-specific testing:** For lead and other pipe-related contamination, test the water that actually comes out of your faucet. Labs like Tap Score and National Testing Laboratories offer comprehensive mail-in test kits.
- **Well water:** Annual testing for bacteria and nitrates at minimum. Test for a broader panel (heavy metals, VOCs, radon, arsenic) every 3-5 years or after any event that could affect water quality (flooding, nearby construction, changes in taste or smell).

Start with a water test. Knowing what is actually in your water lets you choose the right filter instead of guessing.
