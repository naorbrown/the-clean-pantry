Tap water in the United States is regulated by the EPA, but "regulated" does not mean "free of contaminants." Municipal water can legally contain dozens of chemicals at levels deemed acceptable by federal standards — standards that many scientists and health advocates argue are outdated. Filtering your drinking water is one of the most impactful things you can do for your household's health.

## What Is in Tap Water

Municipal tap water commonly contains some combination of the following:

- **Chlorine or chloramine.** Added intentionally as disinfectants. Effective at killing bacteria, but you do not need to keep consuming them once the water reaches your glass.
- **Fluoride.** Added to most municipal supplies for dental health. Whether this is beneficial or harmful at the concentrations used is a matter of ongoing debate. If you want to remove it, you will need reverse osmosis or a specialized fluoride filter — standard carbon filters do not remove fluoride.
- **Lead.** Leaches from old pipes, solder joints, and fixtures. Even low levels are harmful, especially for children. Lead contamination is a plumbing issue — it enters the water between the treatment plant and your tap.
- **PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).** Persistent synthetic chemicals found in an alarming number of water supplies. Used in nonstick coatings, food packaging, and firefighting foam. They do not break down in the environment and accumulate in the body over time.
- **Pharmaceuticals and hormones.** Trace amounts of medications (antibiotics, hormones, antidepressants) pass through wastewater treatment and end up in tap water. Concentrations are low but the long-term effects of chronic low-dose exposure are not well understood.
- **Disinfection byproducts (DBPs).** Formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water. Includes trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Regulated but present in virtually all chlorinated water.
- **Microplastics.** Found in tap water worldwide. The health implications are still being studied.

## Filter Types

### Pitcher Filters (Brita-Style)

The most common and most basic option.

- **What they remove:** Chlorine taste and odor, some heavy metals (varies by model), some particulates
- **What they do not remove:** Fluoride, PFAS (some newer models claim partial PFAS reduction), most pharmaceuticals, chloramine
- **Pros:** Cheap, no installation, widely available
- **Cons:** Slow, limited capacity, filter media is minimal, frequent replacements
- **Best for:** Better-than-nothing chlorine taste improvement

Pitcher filters are a starting point, not a solution. If you are serious about water quality, you will outgrow them quickly.

### Carbon Block Filters

A significant step up from pitcher filters, carbon block filters use densely compressed activated carbon.

- **What they remove:** Chlorine, VOCs, many organic contaminants, improved taste and odor, some models remove lead and cysts
- **What they do not remove:** Fluoride, dissolved minerals, most PFAS, chloramine (requires catalytic carbon)
- **Installation:** Under-sink (most common), countertop, or faucet-mounted
- **Filter life:** 6-12 months depending on capacity and usage
- **Pros:** Good balance of performance, cost, and convenience. No water waste. Retains beneficial minerals.
- **Cons:** Does not address fluoride or dissolved solids

Carbon block filters with catalytic carbon can handle chloramine. Look for NSF/ANSI 42 (taste/odor) and 53 (health contaminants) certifications to verify performance claims.

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)

RO systems force water through a semipermeable membrane that blocks contaminants at the molecular level.

- **What they remove:** Virtually everything — fluoride, lead, PFAS, arsenic, nitrates, dissolved solids, bacteria, pharmaceuticals
- **What they do not remove:** Some VOCs and gases (most RO systems include a carbon pre-filter to catch these)
- **Installation:** Under-sink with a dedicated faucet, or countertop
- **Filter life:** Pre-filters every 6-12 months, RO membrane every 2-3 years
- **Pros:** The most thorough filtration available for residential use
- **Cons:** Wastes 2-4 gallons of water for every gallon filtered (improving with newer models), removes beneficial minerals along with contaminants, requires remineralization, higher cost, slower flow rate

RO is the standard recommendation if you want to remove fluoride, PFAS, or dissolved heavy metals. The water waste is a legitimate concern but newer systems have improved ratios.

### Gravity Filters (Berkey-Style)

Gravity filters use no electricity or water pressure. Water passes through filter elements by gravity alone.

- **What they remove:** Bacteria, parasites, chlorine, VOCs, heavy metals, some pharmaceuticals (performance varies by model and filter element)
- **What they do not remove:** Fluoride (without optional fluoride filter elements), dissolved minerals
- **Installation:** None — a freestanding countertop unit
- **Filter life:** Filter elements last thousands of gallons (often years)
- **Pros:** No electricity, no plumbing, no water waste, very long filter life, portable, works during power outages
- **Cons:** Slow (gravity-fed), takes counter space, independent testing has shown variable performance between units, some models have faced regulatory scrutiny

Gravity filters are a strong option for people who rent, want portability, or want filtration that works without infrastructure. Do your research on specific brands and models — third-party testing data is more reliable than manufacturer claims.

## Remineralization After Reverse Osmosis

RO water is very pure, but that means it has also lost beneficial minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Drinking demineralized water long-term can contribute to mineral deficiency, and the water tastes flat.

Options for remineralization:

- **Inline remineralization filter.** Installs after the RO membrane and adds minerals back as water passes through. Most convenient.
- **Mineral drops.** Concentrated trace mineral drops added to each glass or pitcher. Simple and portable.
- **Himalayan salt sole.** A saturated salt solution added in small amounts. Adds sodium and trace minerals. Use sparingly.

Most under-sink RO systems offer an optional remineralization stage. It is worth including.

## Well Water vs Municipal Water

The filtration approach differs depending on your water source.

**Municipal water:**
- Already treated and disinfected — your main concerns are disinfection byproducts, lead from pipes, PFAS, and fluoride (if you want to remove it)
- A quality carbon block filter handles most concerns; add RO if you need fluoride or PFAS removal

**Well water:**
- Untreated — you are responsible for all water quality
- Common issues: bacteria (E. coli, coliform), nitrates (from agricultural runoff), iron, manganese, sulfur (rotten egg smell), hardness, radon, arsenic
- Testing is essential and should be done annually at minimum
- Treatment often requires multiple stages: sediment pre-filter, UV sterilization for bacteria, specific media for iron/manganese, and a final carbon or RO stage

## How to Get Your Water Tested

- **Municipal water:** Your water utility publishes an annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR). Request it or find it on their website. This tells you what is in the water as it leaves the treatment plant — but not what it picks up between there and your tap.
- **Tap-specific testing:** For lead and other pipe-related contamination, test the water that actually comes out of your faucet. Labs like Tap Score and National Testing Laboratories offer comprehensive mail-in test kits.
- **Well water:** Annual testing for bacteria and nitrates at minimum. Test for a broader panel (heavy metals, VOCs, radon, arsenic) every 3-5 years or after any event that could affect water quality (flooding, nearby construction, changes in taste or smell).

Start with a water test. Knowing what is actually in your water lets you choose the right filter instead of guessing.
