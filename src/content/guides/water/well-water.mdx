If your home is on a private well, you are your own water utility. There is no treatment plant, no regulatory testing, and no annual water quality report coming in the mail. The quality of your water is entirely your responsibility, and it can change over time due to weather, land use, and the condition of your well system. Regular testing and appropriate treatment are not optional — they are essential.

## Annual Testing: The Non-Negotiable Minimum

At a bare minimum, test your well water once a year for:

- **Total coliform bacteria and E. coli.** The most important annual test. Coliform bacteria indicate potential contamination from surface water, sewage, or animal waste. E. coli specifically indicates fecal contamination and is an immediate health threat.
- **Nitrates.** Primarily from agricultural fertilizer runoff, septic system leachate, and animal waste. Especially dangerous for infants (causes methemoglobinemia, or "blue baby syndrome"). EPA maximum contaminant level is 10 mg/L.
- **pH level.** Affects the corrosiveness of your water. Low pH (acidic water, below 6.5) corrodes pipes and can leach metals like lead and copper into your water. High pH (above 8.5) can cause scaling and reduce the effectiveness of disinfection.

Beyond the annual basics, test for a comprehensive panel every 3-5 years:

- Heavy metals (arsenic, lead, copper, uranium)
- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) if you are near industrial, agricultural, or commercial areas
- Radon (especially in granite bedrock regions)
- Hardness (calcium and magnesium levels)
- Total dissolved solids (TDS)

## Common Well Water Issues

### Iron and Manganese

Among the most common well water complaints. These naturally occurring minerals are not dangerous at typical levels but cause significant nuisance problems.

- **Symptoms:** Orange, brown, or black staining on fixtures, laundry, and toilets. Metallic taste. Slimy buildup in pipes and toilet tanks (iron bacteria).
- **Iron types:** Ferrous iron (dissolved, clear water that turns orange when exposed to air) and ferric iron (already oxidized, visible particles).
- **Treatment:** Oxidizing filter (for moderate levels), air injection followed by filtration (for higher levels), or a water softener (for low levels of ferrous iron only). Iron bacteria require shock chlorination plus ongoing treatment.

### Sulfur (Hydrogen Sulfide)

- **Symptoms:** Rotten egg smell, especially in hot water. Black staining on fixtures.
- **Treatment:** Aeration, oxidizing filter, or activated carbon filtration depending on concentration. If the smell is only in hot water, the issue may be your water heater's anode rod reacting with bacteria — replacing the magnesium anode with an aluminum or powered anode can resolve it.

### Hardness

Hard water contains high levels of dissolved calcium and magnesium.

- **Symptoms:** White scale buildup on fixtures and in pipes, reduced soap lathering, dry skin and hair, spots on dishes and glassware, reduced appliance lifespan.
- **Treatment options:**
  - **Salt-based water softeners.** The traditional and most effective option. Uses ion exchange to replace calcium and magnesium with sodium. Requires periodic salt refills and produces brine wastewater.
  - **Salt-free water conditioners.** Do not actually remove hardness minerals — instead, they change the mineral structure so it does not form scale as readily. Less effective than salt-based systems but require no salt and produce no waste. Better described as "scale prevention" than "softening."
  - **Which to choose:** If hardness is above 10-15 grains per gallon and you have significant scaling issues, a salt-based softener is more effective. For moderate hardness or if you want to avoid sodium in your water, a salt-free conditioner may be sufficient.

### Low pH (Acidic Water)

- **Symptoms:** Blue-green staining from copper pipe corrosion, pinhole leaks in copper plumbing, metallic taste.
- **Treatment:** Acid neutralizer (calcite filter or soda ash injection). A calcite filter adds calcium carbonate as water passes through, raising the pH. Also increases hardness, so you may need a softener downstream.

## UV Sterilization for Bacteria

UV sterilization is the preferred method for ongoing bacterial treatment of well water:

- Kills bacteria, viruses, and parasites (including Giardia and Cryptosporidium) by disrupting their DNA
- Chemical-free — does not add anything to the water and does not change taste
- Requires clear water to work (sediment and turbidity block UV light) — always install a sediment pre-filter before the UV unit
- Requires electricity — does not work during power outages (keep bottled water as backup)
- Bulb replacement typically every 12 months
- Does not provide residual disinfection — treats water at the point of installation only

UV is ideal for ongoing maintenance of a well that tests positive for coliform but is otherwise in good condition. It is not a substitute for identifying and fixing the source of contamination.

## Shock Chlorination

Shock chlorination is the standard procedure for disinfecting a well that tests positive for bacteria:

1. Calculate your well's volume based on diameter and water depth
2. Add the appropriate amount of unscented household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) to achieve a 200 ppm chlorine concentration throughout the system
3. Run water through every faucet until you smell chlorine, then shut everything off
4. Let the chlorinated water sit in the well and plumbing for 12-24 hours
5. Flush the entire system until chlorine is no longer detectable
6. Retest for bacteria 1-2 weeks after flushing

Shock chlorination is a one-time treatment, not an ongoing solution. If bacteria return after shock chlorination, you need to identify the contamination source (cracked well casing, surface water infiltration, failed well cap seal) and fix it. Continuous chlorination or UV sterilization may be necessary for persistent contamination.

## When to Test More Frequently

Beyond your annual schedule, test your water immediately if any of the following occur:

- **Flooding or heavy rains.** Surface water can infiltrate your well through the well cap, casing cracks, or saturated soil.
- **Nearby construction or land use changes.** New septic systems, excavation, road work, or agricultural activity near your well can introduce contaminants.
- **Changes in taste, color, or odor.** Any change in your water's sensory characteristics warrants testing. Trust your senses.
- **Illness in the household.** Unexplained gastrointestinal illness, especially affecting multiple family members, should prompt immediate bacterial testing.
- **Well system work.** Any time the well pump, pressure tank, or plumbing is opened for repairs, bacteria can be introduced. Test and shock chlorinate after any well system maintenance.
- **New baby in the household.** Infants are especially vulnerable to nitrates and bacteria. Test before and shortly after the baby arrives.
- **Seasonal changes.** Spring snowmelt and heavy rain seasons are higher risk for bacterial contamination. Consider testing twice a year if you are in an area with significant seasonal water table fluctuations.

## Where to Get Your Water Tested

- **State-certified labs.** Contact your state health department for a list of certified drinking water testing labs. Many offer well water panels at reasonable cost.
- **Mail-in test kits.** Services like Tap Score offer comprehensive well water testing panels that include sample collection materials and prepaid shipping.
- **County health departments.** Some counties offer free or subsidized bacterial testing for private wells.

The cost of annual testing is minimal compared to the cost of treating a waterborne illness or discovering contamination after years of exposure. Make it a routine, the same way you would schedule an annual physical or a furnace inspection.
