## What a Whole-House Filter Does

A whole-house water filter installs at the main water line where it enters your home, treating every drop of water before it reaches any faucet, shower, appliance, or hose bib. Unlike point-of-use filters (under-sink or pitcher filters) that treat water at a single location, a whole-house system ensures that the water you shower in, wash clothes with, and use for cooking is all filtered.

This matters because contaminant exposure is not limited to drinking. Chlorine and chloramine in shower water become airborne as steam, and you inhale them in an enclosed bathroom. Hot water increases the release of volatile organic compounds. Unfiltered water running through appliances deposits sediment and minerals that shorten equipment lifespan.

## Common Contaminants Addressed

Whole-house filters are designed to handle contaminants that affect the entire water supply:

- **Sediment** -- sand, rust, silt, and particulates from aging pipes or well sources
- **Chlorine and chloramine** -- municipal disinfectants that dry skin, damage hair, and degrade rubber seals in appliances
- **Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)** -- industrial chemicals that can enter groundwater
- **Iron and manganese** -- common in well water, causing staining and metallic taste
- **Hydrogen sulfide** -- the rotten egg smell found in some well water

Whole-house systems are generally not designed to remove fluoride, dissolved heavy metals at trace levels, or PFAS. For those, you still need a point-of-use system (reverse osmosis) at the kitchen sink for drinking water. A whole-house filter and an under-sink RO system complement each other well.

## System Types

### Sediment Pre-Filter

Every whole-house setup should start with a sediment pre-filter, typically rated at 5-20 microns. This catches large particles before they reach the main filter, extending its life and protecting downstream equipment. Sediment filters are inexpensive and easy to replace.

### Carbon Filtration

Granular activated carbon (GAC) or carbon block filters are the core of most whole-house systems. Carbon adsorbs chlorine, chloramine (catalytic carbon required), VOCs, and organic compounds through a chemical bonding process. Flow rate and contact time are critical -- the water must spend enough time in contact with the carbon to remove contaminants effectively.

### KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) Media

KDF media uses a copper-zinc alloy to remove chlorine, heavy metals, and hydrogen sulfide through an electrochemical process. It also inhibits bacterial growth within the filter housing. KDF is often used in combination with carbon for broader contaminant coverage.

### Iron and Manganese Filters

For well water with iron or manganese, specialized oxidizing filters (birm, greensand, or air injection systems) convert dissolved iron and manganese into solid particles that the filter can trap. These are essential for well water but unnecessary for municipal water.

## Sizing and Flow Rate

The most common mistake in whole-house filtration is undersizing the system. A filter that restricts flow causes low water pressure throughout the house, which leads to frustration and premature removal.

- **Measure your peak flow rate.** A typical household uses 10-15 gallons per minute (GPM) during peak demand (multiple showers, dishwasher, and washing machine running simultaneously).
- **Choose a system rated above your peak demand.** If your peak is 12 GPM, choose a system rated for at least 15 GPM.
- **Pipe diameter matters.** A system with 1-inch ports on a 3/4-inch main line will not improve flow. Match the filter port size to your main line or go one size up.

## Installation Considerations

- **Location.** Install after the main shutoff valve and pressure regulator but before the water heater and any branch lines. This ensures all water in the house is filtered.
- **Bypass valve.** Always install a bypass valve so you can change filters or service the system without shutting off water to the entire house.
- **Drain connection.** Some systems (particularly iron filters with backwash cycles) need a drain connection for flushing.
- **Pressure drop.** Every filter adds some pressure drop. Measure your incoming pressure and ensure you have adequate pressure after the filter. Most homes have 40-60 PSI; a well-sized whole-house filter should only reduce pressure by 2-5 PSI.

## Maintenance

- **Sediment pre-filter:** Replace every 3-6 months depending on water quality. Check monthly during the first year to establish your replacement schedule.
- **Carbon filter:** Replace every 6-12 months or at the manufacturer's recommended gallon capacity. Carbon that is exhausted no longer removes contaminants, even though water still flows through it.
- **KDF media:** Lasts 5-6 years in most residential applications.
- **Iron filters with backwash:** The media bed regenerates during backwash cycles. Media replacement is needed every 5-10 years.

Keep a maintenance log with filter change dates and water quality observations. It takes the guesswork out of replacement schedules.

## Budget Ranges

- **Basic sediment + carbon system:** $300-600 installed. Handles chlorine, sediment, and VOCs.
- **Mid-range multi-stage system:** $800-1,500 installed. Carbon, KDF, and sediment with higher flow rates and longer filter life.
- **Well water system with iron removal:** $1,500-3,000 installed. Includes oxidizing filter, sediment, and carbon stages.

Annual filter replacement costs typically run $50-200 depending on the system. This is significantly less than the cumulative cost of replacing point-of-use filters at every faucet and showerhead in the house.
