You absorb chemicals through your skin and inhale them as steam during a hot shower. A shower filter is one of the simplest, most affordable water quality upgrades.

## Why Shower Water Matters

Municipal water contains chlorine or chloramine for disinfection. Safe for the water supply, but these chemicals have side effects during bathing:

- **Skin absorption.** Warm water opens pores, increasing chemical absorption through skin.
- **Vapor inhalation.** Chlorine and chloramine become volatile in hot water. You inhale them as steam for 10-15 minutes per shower.
- **Skin and hair effects.** Chlorine strips natural oils, causing dryness, irritation, eczema flare-ups, and brittle hair.
- **Disinfection byproducts.** Chlorine reacts with organic matter to form trihalomethanes (THMs), which readily become airborne in shower steam.

## Types of Shower Filters

### KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) Filters

KDF filters use a copper-zinc alloy to remove contaminants through a redox reaction.

- **Effective against:** Free chlorine, heavy metals (lead, mercury), hydrogen sulfide
- **Less effective against:** Chloramine, VOCs
- **Lifespan:** 6-12 months
- **Pros:** Works in hot water (unlike carbon), controls bacterial growth in the filter
- **Cons:** Does not remove chloramine effectively, higher upfront cost

KDF is the most common shower filter type. Its hot-water performance is the key advantage over carbon.

### Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) Filters

Vitamin C neutralizes both chlorine and chloramine, converting them to harmless chloride.

- **Effective against:** Free chlorine and chloramine (the key advantage)
- **Less effective against:** Heavy metals, VOCs, sediment
- **Lifespan:** 1-3 months (vitamin C is consumed in the reaction)
- **Pros:** The only shower filter that reliably removes chloramine
- **Cons:** Frequent replacements, higher ongoing cost, no heavy metal removal

If your utility uses chloramine (check your water quality report), vitamin C is your best option.

### Activated Carbon Filters

Carbon adsorbs contaminants onto the surface of activated carbon granules.

- **Effective against:** Chlorine, VOCs, some organic compounds
- **Less effective against:** Chloramine, heavy metals
- **Lifespan:** 3-6 months
- **Pros:** Affordable, good for chlorine and VOC removal
- **Cons:** Loses effectiveness in hot water -- heat releases adsorbed contaminants back into the water

Some shower filters combine carbon with KDF for broader coverage.

## Installation Options

### Inline Filters

Installs between the shower arm and your existing showerhead:

- Keeps your current showerhead
- Universal 1/2-inch fit, hand-tighten with plumber's tape
- Adds a few inches of length to the shower arm

### Filtered Showerheads

All-in-one units that replace your showerhead:

- Cleaner look -- no extra housing visible
- Filter fits inside the handle
- Smaller cartridge capacity than inline filters

Either works. Inline filters generally have more media and longer cartridge life.

## Filter Maintenance and Replacement

- **Follow the replacement schedule.** An exhausted filter does nothing. Replace every 3-6 months (vitamin C) or 6-12 months (KDF).
- **Track your install date.** Write it on the housing with a marker.
- **Watch for reduced flow.** Pressure drops signal a clogged filter.
- **Hard water areas.** Sediment buildup shortens filter life. Consider a whole-house sediment pre-filter.

## Whole-House Filtration vs Shower Filters

A whole-house system filters every tap, shower, and appliance but costs significantly more. Shower filters are a practical first step:

- $20-60 for the housing, $10-30 per replacement cartridge
- Install in minutes with no plumbing knowledge
- Filter where chemical exposure is highest (hot water, steam, skin contact)
- Work in rentals with no permanent modifications

If you can only do one thing for water quality today, a shower filter gives the most noticeable improvement for the lowest cost.
