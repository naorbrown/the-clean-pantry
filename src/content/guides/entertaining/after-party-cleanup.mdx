## The Night-Of Essentials

Before you go to bed after a party, do these three things. They take 10 minutes and save you significant effort the next morning.

- **Refrigerate all perishable food.** Get leftovers into containers and into the fridge. Food left out for more than 2 hours at room temperature enters the bacterial danger zone and should be discarded.
- **Soak stained linens.** If a tablecloth or napkin has wine, sauce, or candle wax stains, treat them now. Sprinkle baking soda on wet stains and place the items in a basin of cool water with a splash of vinegar. Stains that sit overnight become dramatically harder to remove.
- **Do a glass and bottle sweep.** Collect all glasses, bottles, and cans from every room. Load the dishwasher with what fits and leave the rest stacked neatly by the sink. Toss recyclables.

Everything else can wait until morning.

## The Morning-After Routine

Work through these tasks in order. The entire process takes 45-60 minutes for a typical dinner party.

### Step 1: Kitchen First (20 Minutes)

The kitchen is always the biggest job. Start here while you have the most energy.

- Finish loading and run the dishwasher if it is not already going.
- Hand-wash delicate items: wine glasses, crystal, serving platters, and anything too large for the dishwasher.
- Wipe all countertops and the stovetop with your all-purpose cleaner.
- Clean the sink thoroughly -- it has been working hard.
- Take out the trash and recycling. Replace liners.
- Wipe the outside of the stove, refrigerator, and any appliances that were used.

### Step 2: Dining Area (10 Minutes)

- Remove the tablecloth or placemats and shake them out outside or over the trash.
- Wipe the table surface with all-purpose cleaner.
- Check chairs for spills or food crumbs. Wipe seats and legs as needed.
- Sweep or vacuum under the table.

### Step 3: Living and Common Areas (10 Minutes)

- Collect any remaining dishes, napkins, or trash from every room.
- Fluff and rearrange couch cushions and throw pillows.
- Wipe coffee tables and side tables.
- Vacuum or sweep the floor, focusing on high-traffic paths.

### Step 4: Bathrooms (5 Minutes Each)

- Wipe the toilet seat, handle, and rim.
- Clean the sink and faucet.
- Replace used hand towels with clean ones.
- Empty the trash.
- Restock toilet paper and hand soap if low.

### Step 5: Floors Last (10 Minutes)

Floors are last because crumbs and debris fall during the other tasks.

- Sweep or vacuum all hard floors.
- Mop high-traffic areas with your post-party floor cleaner (vinegar, castile soap, and warm water).
- Pay special attention to the kitchen floor and the area around the dining table.

## Stain Triage

Check for stains before they set permanently.

- **Red wine on carpet or upholstery:** Blot (do not rub), apply salt or baking soda to absorb, then treat with a dish soap and vinegar solution.
- **Candle wax on hard surfaces:** Freeze with ice, scrape off with a plastic scraper, then wipe residue with vinegar.
- **Grease spots on fabric:** Sprinkle baking soda on the spot, let it sit for 15 minutes to absorb the oil, then brush off and launder.
- **Water rings on wood:** Rub a small amount of olive oil into the ring with a soft cloth, then buff dry.

## Restoring Your Home to Normal

Once the major cleanup is done, take a few minutes to reset your home.

- Put furniture back in its original position if you rearranged for the party.
- Open windows for 15-20 minutes to air out cooking smells and refresh the indoor air.
- Run a load of party laundry: tablecloths, napkins, dish towels, hand towels.
- Restock your cleaning supplies if you used a significant amount during cleanup.
