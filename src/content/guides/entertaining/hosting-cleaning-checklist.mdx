## The Approach: Clean What Guests Will See and Touch

You do not need to deep-clean your entire home before hosting. Focus on the rooms guests will actually use and the surfaces they will see and touch. This checklist works for dinner parties, holiday gatherings, game nights, and overnight guests. Start 1-2 hours before guests arrive and work through each room in order.

## Entryway and Front Door

The first impression matters. This takes 5 minutes.

- Sweep or vacuum the entryway floor and shake out the doormat.
- Wipe the front door handle, doorbell, and light switch with an all-purpose cleaner (vinegar and water).
- Clear shoe clutter and coat hooks so guests have space for their belongings.
- Make sure the porch light works. Replace the bulb if needed.

## Living Room and Dining Area

This is where guests spend the most time. Allow 15-20 minutes.

- Clear coffee tables and side tables of clutter. Guests need space to set down drinks.
- Wipe all hard surfaces (tables, shelves, TV stand) with your all-purpose cleaner.
- Fluff throw pillows and fold blankets neatly on the couch.
- Vacuum or sweep the floor, paying attention to visible areas under the coffee table and around dining chairs.
- Set the dining table in advance if you are hosting a sit-down meal. Polish glassware with a vinegar rinse for a streak-free shine.
- Check for pet hair on upholstered furniture and use a lint roller if needed.

## Kitchen

Guests always end up in the kitchen. Budget 20 minutes.

- Clear and wipe all countertops. Stash appliances you will not use in a cabinet temporarily.
- Clean the sink and faucet -- a sparkling sink makes the whole kitchen look cleaner.
- Run the garbage disposal with lemons, ice, and baking soda to eliminate any odors.
- Empty the trash can and replace the liner. Guests should never see a full trash can.
- Wipe the outside of the refrigerator, oven, and dishwasher with a damp microfiber cloth.
- Make sure hand soap and a clean towel are available at the kitchen sink.

## Guest Bathroom

The most scrutinized room in your home. Give it 15 minutes of attention.

- Scrub the toilet bowl with baking soda and vinegar. Wipe the seat, base, and handle.
- Clean the mirror with a glass cleaner spray (vinegar and water). Streak-free glass signals cleanliness.
- Wipe the sink, faucet, and counter surface.
- Set out fresh hand towels. Run them through a vinegar rinse cycle for extra softness.
- Make sure hand soap is full and within reach.
- Empty the bathroom trash can.
- Place a guest bathroom refresh spray under the sink for guests to use discreetly.

## Guest Bedroom (Overnight Guests)

If guests are staying over, prepare the room 1-2 hours before arrival. This takes 10 minutes.

- Put fresh sheets and pillowcases on the bed. Warm them in the dryer for 5 minutes before making the bed for an inviting feel.
- Clear surfaces of personal items so guests have space for their belongings.
- Mist the room with a lavender room spray 30 minutes before arrival so the scent is subtle, not overwhelming.
- Set out extra blankets and pillows. Guests often have different temperature preferences.
- Check that bedside lighting works and a phone charger is accessible.

## Outdoor Spaces

If guests will be outside, allow 15 minutes for setup.

- Wipe down patio furniture with an outdoor cleaning solution (vinegar, water, and castile soap).
- Sweep the patio, deck, or porch.
- Check outdoor lighting -- string lights, porch lights, pathway lights. Replace any dead bulbs.
- Set out citronella candles or a natural insect repellent if bugs are a concern.
- If grilling, clean the grill grates in advance so you are not scrubbing while guests wait.

## Final Walkthrough (5 Minutes)

Walk through your home as if you are arriving as a guest.

- Enter through the front door. Is the path clear? Does it smell fresh?
- Look at the bathroom. Would you feel comfortable using it?
- Sit on the couch. Can you see dust or clutter from this angle?
- Check the kitchen. Are the counters clear and the sink clean?
- Dim harsh overhead lights and turn on lamps for a warm atmosphere.
