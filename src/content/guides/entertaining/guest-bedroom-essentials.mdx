## Why a Non-Toxic Guest Room Matters

Guests spend 7-9 hours sleeping in your guest room, breathing in whatever is in the air and pressing their skin against your bedding. Commercial air fresheners, scented plug-ins, and fabric softener sheets release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can trigger headaches, allergies, and respiratory irritation -- especially for sensitive guests. A thoughtfully prepared guest room uses simple, non-toxic alternatives that feel just as welcoming.

## Bedding

Start with the surface your guests will be closest to for the longest time.

- **Sheets:** Wash sheets in your regular laundry detergent (castile soap-based) and add 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle. This removes any detergent residue and softens the fabric without synthetic chemicals.
- **Pillows:** If pillows have been stored, fluff them in the dryer on low heat for 10 minutes to remove dust and refresh the fill. Consider offering two pillow firmness options -- guests have different preferences.
- **Blankets and comforters:** Wash or air out any stored bedding at least a day before guests arrive. Bedding stored in closets can develop a musty smell. Hanging it outside for a few hours eliminates this.
- **Mattress:** Sprinkle baking soda over the mattress surface, let it sit for 30 minutes, then vacuum. This neutralizes odors and absorbs moisture from storage.

## Air Quality

A guest room should smell clean, not perfumed.

- **Skip the plug-in air freshener.** These release a constant stream of synthetic fragrance chemicals. Instead, open the window for 15-20 minutes before your guest arrives to flush stale air.
- **Room spray:** Mist the room with a water and lavender essential oil spray 30 minutes before arrival. The scent will be subtle by the time they walk in.
- **Plants:** A small potted plant (snake plant, pothos, or spider plant) adds life to the room and contributes to air quality. These species are low-maintenance and tolerate low light.
- **Avoid scented candles** in the bedroom. Paraffin candles release toluene and benzene when burned. If you want candlelight, use beeswax candles, but not while the guest is sleeping.

## Toiletries and Supplies

Stock the basics so guests do not have to ask.

- **Hand soap:** A simple castile soap in a pump dispenser at the bedside or in the attached bathroom.
- **Lotion:** If you make your own, a small container of a simple body lotion is a thoughtful touch. Otherwise, choose a fragrance-free, short-ingredient-list option.
- **Towels:** Provide at least two towels per guest (bath towel and hand towel). Wash with vinegar rinse for softness.
- **Water:** A glass or carafe of water and a clean glass on the nightstand.
- **Phone charger:** A universal USB charger is one of the most appreciated guest room amenities.

## Lighting and Comfort

- **Bedside lamp:** Make sure the guest has a light they can reach from bed without getting up. Check that the bulb works.
- **Blackout options:** If the room gets morning sun, provide curtains or a sleep mask. Guests may have different light sensitivity.
- **Temperature:** Set the room slightly cool (65-68 degrees F is optimal for sleep) and provide extra blankets so the guest can adjust.
- **Quiet:** If the room is near a noisy area (street, HVAC unit), a small fan for white noise is helpful.

## The Day Before Checklist

Run through this list the day before your guest arrives.

- Wash and make the bed with fresh sheets, pillowcases, and blankets.
- Dust all surfaces: nightstand, dresser, windowsill, baseboards.
- Vacuum or sweep the floor, including under the bed.
- Clear closet or drawer space and provide a few empty hangers.
- Set out towels, toiletries, water, and a phone charger.
- Open the window for 15-20 minutes to air out the room.
- Mist with room spray 30 minutes before arrival.
- Do a final check: sit on the bed, look around the room, and ask yourself if you would feel comfortable sleeping here.
