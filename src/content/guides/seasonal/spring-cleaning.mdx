## Before You Start

Gather supplies in a caddy:

- White vinegar spray (1:1 with water)
- Baking soda
- Castile soap
- Microfiber cloths (6-8)
- Scrub brush
- Mop bucket
- Essential oils (optional)

Work top to bottom in every room. Dust ceilings and fixtures first, then shelves, then floors. Gravity moves debris downward onto surfaces you haven't cleaned yet.

## Kitchen

- **Appliances:** Pull the fridge out and vacuum condenser coils. Clean shelves with baking soda paste (2 tbsp per quart). Microwave: heat 1 cup vinegar for 3 minutes, let sit 5 minutes with the door closed, then wipe.
- **Cabinets:** Wipe exteriors with castile soap solution (1 tsp per quart). Focus above the stove where grease builds up.
- **Sink and drain:** Scrub the sink with baking soda. Pour 1/2 cup baking soda then 1 cup vinegar down the drain, fizz 15 minutes, flush with boiling water.
- **Floors:** Sweep, then mop with 1/4 cup vinegar per gallon of warm water.

## Bathrooms

- **Tile and grout:** Baking soda paste on grout, spray vinegar, scrub after it fizzes.
- **Toilet:** 1 cup vinegar in the bowl for 30 minutes, then scrub. Baking soda around the rim for extra abrasion.
- **Shower head:** Bag of vinegar tied around the nozzle overnight dissolves mineral deposits.
- **Exhaust fan:** Remove cover, wash in warm soapy water, vacuum fan blades.

## Bedrooms

- **Mattress:** Strip the bed, sprinkle baking soda over the surface, wait 30-60 minutes, vacuum thoroughly.
- **Pillows:** Most synthetic pillows can be machine-washed on gentle with a tablespoon of castile soap. Dry completely.
- **Under the bed:** Pull everything out, vacuum, wipe down storage containers.

## Living Areas

- **Upholstery:** Remove cushions, vacuum crevices. Baking soda on fabric for 15 minutes, then vacuum.
- **Windows:** 1:1 vinegar and water spray with a lint-free cloth. Clean tracks with a damp cloth around a butter knife.
- **Baseboards and vents:** Wipe baseboards with damp microfiber. Remove vent covers, wash in soapy water, vacuum duct openings.
- **Light fixtures:** Remove glass globes and wash by hand. Dust cool bulbs with a dry cloth.

## Do Not Skip These

1. **Replace or clean HVAC filters.** A clogged filter recirculates dust and strains the system.
2. **Wash curtains and blinds.** Machine-wash curtains on gentle. Wipe each blind slat individually.
3. **Clean behind and under appliances.** Behind the stove and under the dishwasher collect grease, crumbs, and moisture that attract pests.

## Pace Yourself

Spread the work across two to three weekends, one or two rooms at a time.
