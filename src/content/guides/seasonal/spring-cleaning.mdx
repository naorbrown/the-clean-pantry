## Why Spring Cleaning Matters

Winter keeps homes sealed up for months. Dust accumulates on surfaces you never see, humidity builds mold in hidden corners, and off-gassing from furniture and finishes concentrates in stagnant air. A thorough spring clean does more than make the house look good -- it resets your indoor environment.

## Before You Start

Gather your supplies in a caddy so you are not running back and forth. For a full spring clean using natural products, you will need:

- White vinegar in a spray bottle (diluted 1:1 with water)
- Baking soda
- Castile soap
- Microfiber cloths (at least 6-8)
- A scrub brush
- A bucket for mopping solution
- Essential oils (optional, for scent)

Work top to bottom in every room. Dust ceiling fans and light fixtures first, then shelves and furniture, then floors last. Gravity does the work for you -- anything you knock loose from above lands on surfaces you have not cleaned yet.

## Kitchen

- **Appliances:** Pull the refrigerator away from the wall and vacuum the condenser coils. Wipe down the top and sides. Clean the inside shelves with a baking soda and water paste (2 tablespoons per quart of water). Run a vinegar steam cycle in the microwave (1 cup of vinegar in a microwave-safe bowl, heat for 3 minutes, let it sit with the door closed for 5 minutes, then wipe).
- **Cabinets:** Wipe the exterior of all cabinets with a castile soap solution (1 teaspoon per quart of warm water). Pay attention to the area above the stove where grease film builds up.
- **Sink and drain:** Scrub the sink with baking soda and a damp cloth. Pour 1/2 cup of baking soda followed by 1 cup of vinegar down the drain. Let it fizz for 15 minutes, then flush with boiling water.
- **Floors:** Sweep, then mop with a vinegar and water solution (1/4 cup vinegar per gallon of warm water).

## Bathrooms

- **Tile and grout:** Make a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to grout lines, spray vinegar over it, and scrub with a stiff brush after it fizzes.
- **Toilet:** Pour 1 cup of vinegar into the bowl, let it sit for 30 minutes, then scrub with a toilet brush. Sprinkle baking soda around the rim for extra scrubbing power.
- **Shower head:** Fill a plastic bag with vinegar, tie it around the shower head so the nozzle is submerged, and leave it overnight. Mineral deposits will dissolve.
- **Exhaust fan:** Remove the cover and wash it in warm soapy water. Vacuum the fan blades carefully.

## Bedrooms

- **Mattress:** Strip the bed completely. Sprinkle baking soda over the entire mattress surface, let it sit for at least 30 minutes (an hour is better), then vacuum it thoroughly. This absorbs moisture and neutralizes odors.
- **Pillows:** Check care labels. Most synthetic pillows can go through the washing machine on a gentle cycle with a tablespoon of castile soap. Dry completely to prevent mold.
- **Under the bed:** Pull everything out. Vacuum dust bunnies and wipe down storage containers.

## Living Areas

- **Upholstery:** Vacuum all cushions, removing them to get into crevices. Sprinkle baking soda on fabric upholstery, let it sit 15 minutes, then vacuum.
- **Windows:** Clean glass with a 1:1 vinegar and water spray and a lint-free cloth or newspaper. Wipe window tracks with a damp cloth wrapped around a butter knife.
- **Baseboards and vents:** Wipe baseboards with a damp microfiber cloth. Remove vent covers and wash them in warm soapy water. Vacuum inside the duct openings as far as you can reach.
- **Light fixtures:** Remove glass globes and wash by hand. Dust bulbs with a dry cloth (make sure they are cool first).

## Do Not Skip These

Three tasks that make the biggest difference and get overlooked most often:

1. **Replace or clean HVAC filters.** A clogged filter forces your system to work harder and recirculates dust. Check the size printed on the current filter and replace it.
2. **Wash curtains and blinds.** Fabric curtains can usually go in the washing machine on a gentle cycle. Wipe each slat of blinds individually with a damp cloth.
3. **Clean behind and under appliances.** The gap behind the stove and the space under the dishwasher collect grease, crumbs, and moisture that attract pests.

## Pace Yourself

A full spring clean does not have to happen in a single weekend. Spread it across two to three weekends, tackling one or two rooms at a time. The goal is thoroughness, not speed.
