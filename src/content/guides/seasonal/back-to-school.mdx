## Why School Supplies Matter

Kids handle pencils, markers, glue, and lunch containers for hours daily. Many contain phthalates (vinyl binders), BPA (plastic containers), and solvents (markers and glue). Since children frequently touch their faces, minimizing exposure through everyday supplies is practical.

## Lunch Containers and Water Bottles

Lunch gear contacts food directly -- prioritize it first.

- **Water bottles:** Stainless steel or borosilicate glass with a silicone sleeve. Avoid polycarbonate (#7, may contain BPA). Tritan or polypropylene (#5) are acceptable BPA-free plastics.
- **Lunch boxes:** Stainless steel bento containers are safest -- no leaching, easy to clean, last for years. Soft-sided bags must be PVC-free (vinyl linings can contain lead and phthalates).
- **Food wraps:** Beeswax wraps or silicone bags replace single-use plastic.

## Writing Instruments

- **Pencils:** Wood-cased graphite pencils are non-toxic (the "lead" is graphite and clay). Cheap painted finishes can contain heavy metals -- choose water-based lacquer or unpainted.
- **Markers:** Water-based with the ACMI AP (Approved Product) seal. Avoid dry-erase markers for young children -- they contain solvents.
- **Crayons:** Major brands are non-toxic. Off-brand imports have tested positive for asbestos. Beeswax crayons are the safest option.
- **Pens:** Water-based or soy-based ink for older students. Skip scented pens.

## Binders, Folders, and Backpacks

- **Binders:** PVC 3-ring binders are a top phthalate source in school supplies. Choose polypropylene or recycled cardboard instead.
- **Folders:** Paper and cardboard over plastic. Recyclable, no off-gassing.
- **Backpacks:** Nylon, polyester, or canvas -- not PVC. Check that fabric is PFAS-free (no fluorinated water-repellent coatings).

## Glue and Adhesives

- **White glue and glue sticks** (PVA-based) are non-toxic and safe for all ages.
- **Rubber cement and super glue** need ventilation; older students only.
- **Hot glue** is non-toxic once cooled but poses a burn risk for young children.

## Art Supplies

Choose water-based tempera or watercolor over oil-based or acrylic paints. Use natural clay or beeswax modeling compounds over polymer clay (PVC-based, releases fumes when baked). Check for the ACMI AP seal on all art supplies.

## A Practical Approach

Prioritize lunch containers, water bottles, and daily writing instruments first. Replace vinyl binders as they wear out. Over two or three school years, you can transition most supplies without a large upfront cost.
