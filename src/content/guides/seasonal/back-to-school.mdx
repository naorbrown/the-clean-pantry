## Why School Supplies Matter

Children spend hours each day handling pencils, markers, glue, and lunch containers. Many conventional school supplies contain chemicals like phthalates in vinyl binders, lead in painted pencils, BPA in plastic containers, and volatile solvents in markers and glue. Since children frequently touch their faces and mouths, minimizing exposure through everyday supplies is a practical step.

## Lunch Containers and Water Bottles

Lunch gear has the most direct contact with food, so it deserves the most scrutiny.

- **Water bottles:** Choose stainless steel or borosilicate glass with a silicone sleeve. Avoid polycarbonate plastic (often marked #7) which may contain BPA. If you prefer plastic, look for bottles made from Tritan copolyester or polypropylene (#5), both of which are BPA-free and durable.
- **Lunch boxes:** Stainless steel bento-style containers are the safest option. They do not leach chemicals, are easy to clean, and last for years. If you use a soft-sided lunch bag, check that it is PVC-free -- PVC (vinyl) linings can contain lead and phthalates.
- **Food wraps:** Beeswax wraps or silicone food bags replace single-use plastic wrap and sandwich bags. Both are reusable and avoid plasticizer exposure.

## Writing Instruments

- **Pencils:** Standard wood-cased graphite pencils are inherently non-toxic. The "lead" in pencils is actually graphite and clay -- no actual lead is involved. However, painted finishes on cheap pencils can contain heavy metals. Look for pencils finished with water-based lacquer or left unpainted.
- **Markers:** Water-based markers are significantly safer than solvent-based ones. Look for markers labeled AP (Approved Product) by the Art & Creative Materials Institute (ACMI). Avoid dry-erase markers for young children -- they typically contain isopropanol and other solvents.
- **Crayons:** Most major-brand crayons are non-toxic, but off-brand imports have occasionally tested positive for asbestos in talc-based formulations. Stick with established brands that conduct regular third-party testing, or choose beeswax crayons, which are made from natural materials.
- **Pens:** For older students, look for pens with water-based or soy-based ink. Avoid scented pens and inks, which add synthetic fragrance compounds.

## Binders, Folders, and Backpacks

- **Binders:** Standard vinyl (PVC) 3-ring binders are one of the most common sources of phthalate exposure in school supplies. Choose polypropylene binders instead -- they are flexible, durable, and phthalate-free. Some brands make binders from recycled cardboard, which avoids plastic entirely.
- **Folders:** Paper and cardboard folders are preferable to plastic. They are recyclable and do not off-gas.
- **Backpacks:** Look for backpacks made from nylon, polyester, or canvas rather than PVC. Check that the fabric is free of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are used as water-repellent coatings. Some outdoor brands now offer PFAS-free water-resistant treatments.

## Glue and Adhesives

- **White glue and glue sticks** (PVA-based) are non-toxic and safe for all ages. These are the standard for elementary school use.
- **Rubber cement and super glue** contain solvents and cyanoacrylate, respectively, and should only be used by older students with adequate ventilation.
- **Hot glue** is non-toxic once cooled but poses a burn risk. Adult supervision is appropriate for younger children.

## Art Supplies

Art class introduces additional chemical exposure. For paints, choose water-based tempera or watercolor over oil-based or acrylic. For clay, natural clay or beeswax-based modeling compounds are safer than polymer clay, which is PVC-based and releases fumes when baked.

Always check for the ACMI AP seal on any art supply. This certification means the product has been evaluated by a toxicologist and found to be safe for children, including those with special needs who might mouth materials.

## A Practical Approach

You do not need to replace every item at once. Prioritize swapping the things your child handles most frequently and that have the highest exposure risk: lunch containers, water bottles, and daily-use writing instruments. Replace vinyl binders and folders as they wear out. Over two or three school years, you can transition most supplies without a large upfront cost.
