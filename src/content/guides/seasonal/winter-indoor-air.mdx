## Why Winter Air Quality Suffers

Sealed homes recirculate the same air all season. VOCs from furniture and cleaners, CO2, cooking moisture, dust mites, and pet dander accumulate without fresh air exchange. Indoor air can be 2-5x more polluted than outdoor air, and the gap widens in winter.

## Humidity: The Critical Balance

**Too dry (below 30% RH):**

- Dry skin, nosebleeds, irritated sinuses
- Weakened mucous membranes, more respiratory infections
- Static electricity

**Too humid (above 50% RH):**

- Mold growth, dust mite reproduction
- Window condensation leading to wood rot
- Clammy feel despite running heat

Target 30-50% RH. A hygrometer (under $15) lets you monitor. Use a cool-mist humidifier if too dry (avoid warm-mist -- bacteria risk). Run exhaust fans longer or add a dehumidifier if too humid.

## Ventilation Strategies

- **Crack a window** one inch for 10-15 minutes, once or twice daily in different rooms. Minimal heat loss, meaningful air exchange.
- **Run exhaust fans** 15-20 minutes after showering and during all cooking. They pull stale air out and draw fresh air in.
- **Use "fan on" mode** on your thermostat. Circulates air through the filter even when heat is off.

## HVAC Filter Maintenance

Your furnace filter is the most important winter air quality tool.

- **Check monthly.** Hold it to a light -- if no light passes through, replace it.
- **Use MERV 11-13.** Captures fine dust, mold spores, and pet dander without restricting airflow in most systems. Above MERV 13 can strain your blower motor.
- **Skip fiberglass panel filters** (thin blue/green ones). They protect equipment, not your lungs.

## Reduce Indoor Sources

- **Natural cleaning products.** Vinegar spray, baking soda, and castile soap avoid the VOCs that linger in sealed homes.
- **Skip scented candles and incense.** Use an essential oil diffuser for 30 minutes max with ventilation.
- **Range hood on high while cooking.** Gas stoves produce particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Open a window if you lack a hood.
- **Shoes off at the door.** Shoes track in pesticides and heavy metals that settle into carpet and re-enter the air.

## Houseplants: Manage Expectations

You would need hundreds of plants in one room for measurable air filtration. Enjoy them for aesthetics, but rely on your HVAC filter for actual air cleaning.
