## Why Winter Air Quality Suffers

During winter, most homes are sealed tight to conserve heat. Windows stay closed, weatherstripping blocks drafts, and the HVAC system recirculates the same air. Without fresh air exchange, indoor pollutants accumulate -- VOCs from furniture and cleaning products, carbon dioxide from breathing, moisture from cooking and showering, dust mites, and pet dander. The EPA estimates that indoor air can be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, and this gap widens significantly in winter.

## Humidity: The Critical Balance

Winter indoor air is often too dry, but in some homes -- especially older ones with poor ventilation -- moisture accumulates in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements.

**Too dry (below 30% relative humidity):**

- Causes dry skin, cracked lips, nosebleeds, and irritated sinuses.
- Dries out mucous membranes, making you more susceptible to respiratory infections.
- Creates static electricity that damages electronics and is uncomfortable.

**Too humid (above 50% relative humidity):**

- Promotes mold growth, dust mite reproduction, and bacterial activity.
- Causes condensation on windows, which can lead to wood rot and mold in window frames.
- Creates a clammy, uncomfortable feel despite the heat running.

The ideal range is 30-50% relative humidity. A simple hygrometer (under $15 at any hardware store) lets you monitor levels. If your air is too dry, a cool-mist humidifier helps -- avoid warm-mist humidifiers, which can harbor bacteria and cause burns. If your air is too humid, run exhaust fans longer and consider a dehumidifier in problem areas.

## Ventilation Strategies

You need fresh air exchange even when it is cold outside. The goal is to bring in outdoor air without losing all your heat.

- **Crack a window.** Opening a window just one inch in a room for 10-15 minutes creates a meaningful air exchange without dramatically affecting your heating bill. Do this once or twice a day, ideally in different rooms.
- **Use exhaust fans.** Run the bathroom exhaust fan for 15-20 minutes after showering and the kitchen range hood while cooking. These pull stale, humid air out and create negative pressure that draws fresh air in through small gaps.
- **Use your HVAC fan.** Many thermostats have a "fan on" setting separate from heating. Running the fan circulates air through the filter even when the heat is not actively running, which helps with air mixing and filtration.

## HVAC Filter Maintenance

Your furnace filter is the single most important air quality tool in your home during winter, because all your indoor air passes through it repeatedly.

- **Check the filter monthly.** Hold it up to a light -- if you cannot see light through it, replace it.
- **Choose the right MERV rating.** MERV 11-13 filters capture fine dust, mold spores, and pet dander without restricting airflow in most residential systems. MERV ratings above 13 can reduce airflow and strain your blower motor unless your system is designed for them.
- **Do not use fiberglass panel filters** (the cheap, thin blue or green ones). These only catch large debris and do very little for air quality. They are designed to protect the equipment, not your lungs.

## Reduce Indoor Sources

The most effective way to improve winter air quality is to reduce the amount of pollution being generated indoors.

- **Switch to natural cleaning products.** Commercial cleaners release VOCs that linger in sealed homes. A vinegar spray, baking soda paste, and castile soap solution handle most household cleaning without adding chemicals to the air.
- **Avoid burning scented candles and incense.** Both produce particulate matter and VOCs. If you want fragrance, use an essential oil diffuser in short sessions (30 minutes maximum) with adequate ventilation.
- **Control cooking emissions.** Cooking produces particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, especially gas stoves. Always use the range hood on the highest setting while cooking. If you do not have a range hood, open a nearby window.
- **Remove shoes at the door.** Shoes track in pesticides, heavy metals, and other outdoor pollutants that settle into carpet and get kicked back into the air.

## Houseplants: Manage Expectations

Houseplants do produce oxygen and some studies suggest they can absorb certain VOCs. However, the effect in a normal home is negligible. You would need hundreds of plants in a single room to make a measurable difference in air quality. Enjoy houseplants for their aesthetic value, but do not rely on them as air purifiers. A good HVAC filter does far more work than any number of pothos or snake plants.
