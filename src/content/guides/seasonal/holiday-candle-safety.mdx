## Candle Fire Safety

Candle fires peak in December and January, mostly from unattended flames or placement too close to flammable material.

**Placement rules:**

- Keep candles 12+ inches from curtains, garlands, paper, dried flowers.
- Use a stable, heat-resistant surface (ceramic plate or metal tray). Never directly on wood or tablecloth.
- Keep out of reach of children and pets.
- Never place in a window near blinds or curtains. Curtains move.

**Burning rules:**

- Never leave a burning candle unattended.
- Stop burning when 1/2 inch of wax remains to prevent container overheating.
- Trim wicks to 1/4 inch before each burn to reduce flame size and soot.
- Maximum 4 hours per session to avoid carbon buildup on the wick.
- Keep away from drafts, vents, and fans.

## Choosing Healthier Candles

- **Beeswax and soy wax** burn cleaner than paraffin, which can release toluene and benzene.
- **Cotton or wood wicks** over metal-core wicks. Test metal cores by rubbing on white paper -- lead leaves a gray mark.
- **Essential-oil-scented or unscented** over synthetic fragrance, which can contain phthalates.

## Safer Alternatives to Open Flames

- **Wax melts** with an electric warmer -- no flame, no soot.
- **Essential oil diffusers** -- 3-5 drops of seasonal oils, 30-60 minute sessions.
- **LED flameless candles** -- warm-flicker versions work for table settings and mantels.
- **Simmering potpourri** -- cinnamon sticks, cloves, orange peels, star anise in water at low simmer.

## Essential Oil Safety During Holidays

Holiday blends (cinnamon, clove, pine) require caution:

- **Cinnamon bark oil** is a strong skin irritant. Diffuse at 1-2 drops max.
- **Clove oil** contains eugenol, toxic to cats. Avoid entirely in cat households.
- **Pine and fir oils** are also unsafe for cats due to phenol content.

Pet-safe alternatives: lavender, chamomile, frankincense. Always diffuse in a ventilated room and let pets leave the space.

## Emergency Preparedness

Keep an ABC-rated fire extinguisher accessible -- not in the back of a closet. Never use water on a candle wax fire. Smother with a lid, damp cloth, or extinguisher.
