## The Holiday Fragrance Problem

Candle usage spikes dramatically during the holiday season. The combination of more candles burning for longer periods, dried decorations nearby, and closed-up winter homes creates both fire hazards and air quality concerns. Most of these risks are easy to manage once you know what to watch for.

## Candle Fire Safety

House fires from candles are most common in December and January. The majority start because a candle was left burning unattended or placed too close to something flammable.

**Placement rules:**

- Keep candles at least 12 inches away from anything that can burn -- curtains, garlands, paper decorations, greeting cards, wrapping paper, and dried flower arrangements.
- Place candles on a stable, heat-resistant surface. A ceramic plate or metal tray works well. Never put a candle directly on a wooden shelf, mantel, or tablecloth.
- Keep candles out of reach of children and pets. A cat's tail or a toddler's sleeve is all it takes.
- Never place candles in a window where they can contact blinds or curtains, even if you think there is enough clearance. Curtains move.

**Burning rules:**

- Never leave a burning candle unattended. Blow it out when you leave the room.
- Stop burning a candle when 1/2 inch of wax remains. Below that level, the flame can overheat the container and crack it, or scorch the surface underneath.
- Trim wicks to 1/4 inch before each burn. Long wicks produce larger flames, more soot, and can cause the flame to flicker erratically.
- Do not burn candles for more than 4 hours at a stretch. The wick can develop a carbon "mushroom" that destabilizes the flame.
- Keep burning candles away from drafts, vents, and ceiling fans. Moving air causes uneven burning, dripping, and flare-ups.

## Choosing Healthier Candles

Not all candles are equal from an air quality perspective. When shopping for holiday candles:

- **Beeswax and soy wax** are cleaner-burning than paraffin. Paraffin is a petroleum byproduct that can release toluene and benzene when burned.
- **Cotton or wood wicks** are preferable to lead-core wicks. Lead wicks have been banned in the US since 2003 but still appear in some imported candles. If you can see a metal core in the wick, test it by rubbing the tip on white paper -- lead leaves a gray mark.
- **Unscented or essential-oil-scented** candles are a better choice than candles with synthetic fragrance. Synthetic fragrance blends can contain phthalates and other compounds that add to indoor air pollution.

## Safer Alternatives to Open Flames

If you have young children, pets, or simply prefer not to manage open flames, several alternatives provide holiday ambiance without the fire risk:

- **Beeswax or soy wax melts** with an electric warmer -- no flame, no soot, and the fragrance disperses gently.
- **Essential oil diffusers** -- use 3-5 drops of seasonal oils like cinnamon, clove, orange, or fir needle. Limit diffusing to 30-60 minute sessions.
- **LED flameless candles** -- modern versions with a warm-toned flicker are convincing enough for table settings and mantels. They are completely safe to leave unattended.
- **Simmering potpourri** -- bring a small pot of water to a low simmer with cinnamon sticks, cloves, orange peels, and star anise. The steam carries the scent naturally.

## Essential Oil Safety During Holidays

Holiday essential oil blends typically include cinnamon, clove, and pine -- all of which require caution:

- **Cinnamon bark oil** is a strong skin irritant and should never be applied topically without heavy dilution. When diffusing, use no more than 1-2 drops.
- **Clove oil** contains eugenol, which is toxic to cats. If you have cats, avoid diffusing clove entirely.
- **Pine and fir oils** are also unsafe around cats due to their phenol content.

If you have pets, stick to diffusing lavender, chamomile, or frankincense, which are generally safer. Always diffuse in a well-ventilated room and give pets the option to leave the space.

## Emergency Preparedness

Keep a fire extinguisher accessible during the holiday season -- not buried in the back of a closet. A small ABC-rated extinguisher stored in the kitchen is ideal. Never use water to extinguish a candle wax fire. Smother it with a lid, a damp cloth, or use an extinguisher.
