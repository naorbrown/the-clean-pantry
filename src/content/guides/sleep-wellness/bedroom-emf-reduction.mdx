## Why Focus on the Bedroom

You spend 7-9 hours in your bedroom every night, more continuous time than in any other room. Unlike your waking hours, when you move between rooms and vary your distance from EMF sources, your sleeping position stays fixed relative to whatever electronics and wiring surround you. If you are going to reduce EMF exposure in one room, the bedroom gives you the most return for the least effort.

This guide separates evidence-based steps (supported by mainstream science) from precautionary steps (reasonable but based on less settled evidence). Both are included because the cost of most of these changes is zero to minimal.

## WiFi Routers

Your WiFi router is one of the strongest continuous RF (radiofrequency) sources in your home. It broadcasts constantly, even when no devices are actively using it.

- **Do not keep the WiFi router in the bedroom.** If it is currently in or adjacent to the bedroom, move it to a central location in the home, ideally one room away.
- **Put the router on an outlet timer.** Set it to turn off at bedtime and back on in the morning. This eliminates 7-9 hours of RF exposure with zero impact on your daily internet use.
- **If hardwired internet is feasible, disable WiFi entirely and use ethernet cables.** This is the most thorough option, though not practical for everyone.

## Phone Placement

Cell phones emit RF when communicating with cell towers, and they do this throughout the night -- checking in with the tower, receiving push notifications, and updating apps.

- **Do not charge your phone on the nightstand next to your head.** This is the single most common bedroom EMF exposure and the easiest to fix.
- **Place your phone across the room, or in another room entirely.** If you use it as an alarm, the alarm will still wake you from across the room -- you will just have to get up to turn it off, which is actually an advantage.
- **If you must keep the phone nearby, enable airplane mode.** This disables the cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth radios. Note that alarms still function in airplane mode.
- **Avoid sleeping with the phone under your pillow.** Some people do this for the alarm vibration. Use a standalone alarm clock instead.

## Alarm Clocks and Bedside Electronics

- **Use a battery-powered alarm clock instead of a plug-in digital clock.** Plug-in clocks produce a small ELF (extremely low frequency) magnetic field from the transformer and wiring. Battery-powered clocks produce essentially no EMF.
- **Remove or unplug unnecessary electronics from the bedside area.** Charging cables, smart speakers, tablets -- each adds a small EMF source within arm's reach of where you sleep for 8 hours.
- **If you use a bedside reading lamp, turn it off at the wall (not just the switch) or unplug it when not in use.** Even when off, a plugged-in lamp's wiring carries voltage that produces a small electric field.

## Electrical Panels and Wiring Behind Walls

This one is harder to address because the wiring is hidden.

- **Check what is on the other side of the wall behind your headboard.** If the home's electrical panel, a major appliance (refrigerator, HVAC unit), or the breaker box is on the opposite side, consider moving the bed to a different wall. ELF fields from these sources penetrate drywall easily.
- **Avoid placing the headboard against a wall with a dense concentration of outlets.** Each outlet and its associated wiring produces a low-level field.
- **This is a precautionary step.** ELF field strength from household wiring at typical distances (even through a wall) is quite low. But repositioning a bed is free and permanent.

## Baby Monitors

If you have a baby monitor in or near the bedroom, it is worth knowing that wireless baby monitors operate similarly to WiFi routers -- they broadcast continuously.

- **Place the monitor as far from the baby's head as practical while still getting a useful signal.** Most monitors work fine from across the room.
- **Use an audio-only monitor instead of a video/WiFi monitor when possible.** Audio monitors typically use lower-power DECT or analog signals.
- **If using a WiFi-connected baby camera, do not place it directly next to the crib.** Mount it on the wall at a distance.

## Power Strips and Extension Cords

- **Do not run power strips or extension cords under or alongside the bed.** These carry current and produce ELF fields along their entire length.
- **If you need a power strip in the bedroom (for a lamp, charger, etc.), place it as far from the bed as the cord allows.**
- **Turn off power strips at night using the switch.** This cuts current flow and eliminates the associated fields.

## What Is Evidence-Based vs. Precautionary

The honest answer is that science has not definitively proven that household-level EMF exposure causes health effects. Major organizations (WHO, ICNIRP) consider typical residential exposure levels safe. However, some peer-reviewed research suggests possible biological effects from chronic low-level exposure, particularly during sleep when the body is in repair mode.

The steps in this guide fall into the "costs nearly nothing, might help, definitely does not hurt" category. Moving your phone off the nightstand takes 5 seconds. Putting your router on a timer costs a few dollars. None of these changes have any downside.

Do not let EMF concern become a source of anxiety. If any of these steps feel burdensome or stressful, skip them. Stress itself is an unambiguous health risk. Focus on the easy changes and let the rest go.
