## Why Focus on the Bedroom

You spend 7-9 hours in a fixed position relative to nearby electronics. The bedroom offers the most return for the least effort.

This guide separates evidence-based steps from precautionary ones. Both are included because most cost nothing.

## WiFi Routers

Your router broadcasts continuously, even when no devices are using it.

- **Move the router out of the bedroom.** Place it centrally, at least one room away.
- **Put the router on an outlet timer** to turn off at bedtime. Zero impact on daytime use.
- **Hardwired ethernet** is the most thorough option if feasible.

## Phone Placement

Phones emit RF all night -- checking towers, receiving notifications, updating apps.

- **Do not charge on the nightstand.** Most common bedroom EMF source, easiest to fix.
- **Place across the room or in another room.** Alarms still wake you -- and you have to get up to turn them off.
- **Use airplane mode if the phone must stay close.** Alarms work in airplane mode.
- **Never sleep with the phone under your pillow.** Use a standalone alarm clock.

## Alarm Clocks and Bedside Electronics

- **Battery-powered alarm clock** over plug-in digital clocks (which produce ELF fields from their transformer).
- **Unplug unnecessary bedside electronics** -- chargers, speakers, tablets each add a small source.
- **Unplug or switch off bedside lamps at the wall.** Even off, plugged-in wiring carries voltage.

## Electrical Panels and Wiring Behind Walls

- **Check what is behind your headboard wall.** Electrical panel, fridge, or HVAC unit on the other side? Move the bed to a different wall. ELF fields penetrate drywall.
- **Avoid walls with dense outlet clusters** behind the headboard.
- This is precautionary -- field strength at typical distances is low. But repositioning a bed is free and permanent.

## Baby Monitors

Wireless monitors broadcast continuously, like WiFi routers.

- **Place the monitor across the room** from the baby's head. Most work fine at that distance.
- **Audio-only monitors** use lower-power signals than WiFi video monitors.
- **Wall-mount WiFi cameras** away from the crib, not beside it.

## Power Strips and Extension Cords

- **Never run them under or alongside the bed.** They produce ELF fields along their length.
- **Place power strips as far from the bed as possible.**
- **Switch them off at night** to cut current flow.

## Evidence-Based vs. Precautionary

Science has not proven household EMF causes health effects. WHO and ICNIRP consider typical residential levels safe. Some research suggests possible effects from chronic low-level exposure during sleep.

Every step here costs nearly nothing, might help, and has no downside. Do not let EMF concern become its own stress. Stress is an unambiguous health risk. Focus on the easy changes and let the rest go.
