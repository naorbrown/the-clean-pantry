## Do Bedroom Plants Actually Help You Sleep

In a real bedroom, plant air purification is modest -- you'd need an impractical number to meaningfully filter the air. But there are real benefits: some plants release oxygen at night, aromatic species promote relaxation, and greenery reduces stress.

These plants are selected for low maintenance, nighttime oxygen release, and low allergen potential.

## Best Plants for the Bedroom

### Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)

Performs CAM photosynthesis -- releases oxygen at night. Uniquely suited for bedrooms.

- **Light**: Tolerates low to bright indirect. Survives nearly any condition.
- **Water**: Every 2-3 weeks, only when soil is completely dry.
- **Care**: Nearly indestructible. Tolerates neglect, low humidity, temperature swings.
- **Placement**: Floor or dresser (tall varieties reach 3-4 feet).

### Lavender (Lavandula)

Clinically shown to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, and improve sleep quality.

- **Light**: Bright, direct sunlight -- 6+ hours daily. South-facing window.
- **Water**: When top inch is dry. Prefers drier conditions. Terra cotta pots wick moisture.
- **Care**: More demanding. Needs excellent drainage, air circulation, and plenty of light.
- **Placement**: Sunny windowsill.

### Jasmine (Jasminum polyanthum)

Associated with lower anxiety and improved sleep quality. Blooms fragrant white flowers in late winter through spring.

- **Light**: Bright indirect with some direct sun. East-facing window ideal.
- **Water**: Consistently moist (not soggy) during growing season. Reduce in winter.
- **Care**: Vining plant -- benefits from a trellis. Needs cool period (40-50F) in fall to trigger blooming.
- **Placement**: Near a bright window.

### Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller)

CAM photosynthesis -- releases oxygen at night. Removes some formaldehyde and benzene.

- **Light**: Bright indirect. Tolerates direct sun but may brown if moved suddenly.
- **Water**: Every 2-3 weeks. Let soil dry completely.
- **Care**: Very low maintenance. Cactus/succulent soil mix. Leaf gel useful for minor burns.
- **Placement**: Nightstand or windowsill.

### Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)

Prolific air processor and very resilient. Produces "pups" on arching stems -- easy to propagate.

- **Light**: Bright indirect ideal; tolerates low light. Avoid direct sun.
- **Water**: Weekly when top inch is dry. Forgiving of under-watering.
- **Care**: Brown tips usually mean fluoride in tap water. Use filtered or distilled.
- **Placement**: Hanging planter or high shelf for trailing pups.

### Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)

Extremely adaptable, nearly impossible to kill. Trails beautifully from shelves.

- **Light**: Tolerates low light; thrives in medium indirect.
- **Water**: When top 1-2 inches dry. Leaves droop visibly when thirsty.
- **Care**: Toxic to pets and children. Keep on high shelves or hanging planters.
- **Placement**: Bookshelf, dresser, or hanging planter.

## Plants for Other Rooms

Quick picks for other rooms:

- **Kitchen**: Basil, mint, rosemary on a sunny windowsill -- cooking ingredients plus natural fragrance.
- **Bathroom**: Boston ferns and bird's nest ferns love shower humidity.
- **Living room**: Rubber plant or monstera -- dramatic, low maintenance.
- **Home office**: ZZ plant -- tolerates low light and neglect.

## General Tips for Bedroom Plants

- Pollen allergies? Stick with foliage plants (snake, pothos, spider).
- Don't overwater. Soggy soil breeds mold. Let soil dry between waterings.
- Wipe leaves every few weeks to remove dust.
- Use pots with drainage holes. Standing water causes root rot and mold.
- Start with one or two plants and add from there.
