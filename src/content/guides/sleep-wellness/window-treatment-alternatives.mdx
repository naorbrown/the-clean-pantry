## Why Standard Window Treatments Are a Concern

Window treatments off-gas VOCs into your air -- especially concerning in the bedroom where you breathe 7-9 hours in a closed space.

PVC vinyl blinds and roller shades off-gas phthalates, worsening with heat -- and they sit in direct sunlight all day. Some blackout curtains use foam or rubber coatings with formaldehyde-based resins that produce a chemical smell.

## PVC-Free Blinds

Several materials offer blind functionality without PVC.

### Faux Wood (Composite) Blinds

Wood fiber and polymer composites that look like vinyl without the phthalate off-gassing.

- Look for "PVC-free" explicitly stated. "Eco-friendly" doesn't guarantee it.
- Basswood composite is common and widely available.
- Cost 10-30% more than vinyl but last significantly longer.

### Real Wood Blinds

Solid wood (basswood, bamboo, paulownia) contains no synthetic chemicals.

- Basswood is lightweight and smooth. Ask about the finish -- some lacquers off-gas.
- Look for water-based finishes or unfinished wood.
- Heavier than vinyl. Avoid in high-humidity rooms (bathrooms) -- warping risk.

### Aluminum Blinds

Inert, affordable, zero off-gassing.

- Drawback: industrial look and rattle in drafts.
- Minimal insulation.

## Organic and Natural Fiber Curtains

Curtains offer the widest range of healthy materials.

### Organic Cotton

No pesticide residues, no wrinkle-resistant formaldehyde treatments.

- GOTS certification covers raw material and manufacturing.
- Unbleached, undyed is purest. For color, look for low-impact or plant-based dyes.
- Machine washable -- a significant practical advantage.

### Linen

Durable, breathable, requires fewer chemicals than cotton. Elegant drape that softens over time.

- Naturally anti-static -- attracts less dust.
- More expensive but extremely long-lasting.
- European flax linen (Belgian, French, Lithuanian) is highest quality.

### Hemp

Naturally mold-resistant, minimal pesticides, very durable.

- Rustic, textured appearance -- works well in natural-style interiors.
- Softens with each wash but retains slight stiffness.

## Blackout Options Without Chemicals

Most blackout curtains use foam or rubber back coatings -- the primary source of chemical off-gassing.

### Layering Approach

Pair a natural fiber curtain with a separate blackout liner. The liner is removable -- air it out or replace independently.

- Standalone liners clip behind decorative curtains.
- Choose woven blackout fabric (tightly woven polyester layers) over foam-coated. Darkness through density, not chemicals.

### Tightly Woven Fabrics

Triple-weave polyester (three layers woven together) blocks 95-99% of light without any coating. Polyester is synthetic but stable -- doesn't off-gas like PVC.

### Bamboo Roller Shades with Blackout Liner

Natural bamboo shades paired with a blackout liner provide light control with minimal synthetics.

## Off-Gassing Existing Window Treatments

If replacement is not in the budget:

- **Air them out.** Hang outside 2-3 days. UV and ventilation accelerate off-gassing.
- **Ventilate the room.** Crack a window when possible.
- **Wash what's washable.** Removes surface chemical residues.
- **Replace gradually.** Start with the bedroom -- longest exposure time.

## Quick Decision Guide

- **Best for health**: Organic cotton or linen + woven blackout liner.
- **Best budget**: Aluminum blinds + natural fiber curtain layered over.
- **Best for full darkness**: Triple-weave polyester blackout, PVC-free and formaldehyde-free.
- **Avoid**: PVC vinyl blinds, foam-backed blackout curtains, anything with chemical smell.
