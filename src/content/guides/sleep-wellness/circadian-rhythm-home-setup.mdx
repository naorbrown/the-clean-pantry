## What Is Your Circadian Rhythm

Your circadian rhythm is a ~24-hour clock controlled primarily by light exposure. It coordinates hormone release, body temperature, digestion, and dozens of other processes.

Light, temperature, and meal timing all send signals that support or fight your body's natural timing. Aligning them improves sleep onset, sleep quality, and morning alertness.

## Blue Light and Screens

Blue light (460-480 nm) is the strongest melatonin suppressor. Beneficial during the day, but evening screen use tells your brain it's still daytime.

### What You Can Do

- **Set devices to night mode after sunset.** iOS Night Shift, Android Night Light, Windows/macOS Night Light.
- **Stop screens 60-90 minutes before bed.** Most effective single change. Start with 30 minutes if needed.
- **Use amber/orange blue-blocking glasses** if you must use screens. Clear "blue-light" lenses block very little.
- **Dim screen brightness.** Even with night mode, full brightness in a dark room is significant.

## Morning Light Exposure

Bright light within 30-60 minutes of waking is one of the most powerful circadian signals. It suppresses melatonin, boosts cortisol, and anchors your clock for the day.

### What You Can Do

- **Open curtains immediately.** Even cloudy outdoor light is 10-50x brighter than indoors.
- **Go outside 10-15 minutes.** Direct sunlight is ideal; overcast sky light is still effective.
- **Use a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp** if you wake before sunrise. 16-24 inches away, 20-30 minutes, peripheral vision.
- **Position desk or breakfast area near windows.** More morning light = stronger signal.

## Bedroom Temperature

Your body drops 2-3F to initiate sleep. A warm bedroom fights this drop and delays sleep onset.

### What You Can Do

- **Keep bedroom at 60-67F (15-19C).** Allows natural body cooling.
- **Use breathable bedding.** Cotton, linen, and wool regulate temperature better than polyester.
- **Warm shower 60-90 minutes before bed.** Dilates blood vessels, then rapidly cools core temperature.
- **Keep feet warm.** Cold feet constrict blood vessels and fight core cooling. Socks or a hot water bottle helps.

## Evening Lighting

Home lighting in the 2-3 hours before bed significantly affects melatonin. Bright overhead lights with cool color temperature suppress melatonin nearly as much as screens.

### What You Can Do

- **Switch to 2700K or lower bulbs** in evening rooms. Standard LEDs are 4000-5000K (daylight).
- **Use table/floor lamps instead of overheads.** Lower light sources are less stimulating.
- **Dim lights 1-2 hours before bed.** No dimmers? Switch to a single table lamp.
- **Red or amber nightlights for bathroom trips.** Red wavelengths don't affect melatonin.

## Meal Timing

Your digestive system has its own circadian clock. Late, heavy meals shift peripheral clocks out of sync with your master clock.

### What You Can Do

- **Finish last meal 2-3 hours before bed.** Gives digestion time before lying down.
- **Late snacks: small and protein-forward.** Nuts, cheese, nut butter. Avoid large carb portions.
- **Eat at consistent times daily.** Reinforces circadian rhythm.
- **No caffeine after early afternoon.** Half-life is 5-7 hours.

## Putting It All Together

Start with the highest-impact changes:

1. Morning light within 30 minutes of waking.
2. Screens off (or night mode + dimmed) 60 minutes before bed.
3. Bedroom at 65F.

These three alone meaningfully improve sleep onset and quality. Add others gradually.
