## What Is Your Circadian Rhythm

Your circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour internal clock that regulates when you feel alert and when you feel sleepy. It is controlled primarily by light exposure hitting specialized cells (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells) in your eyes, which signal the suprachiasmatic nucleus in your brain. This master clock then coordinates hormone release, body temperature, digestion, and dozens of other processes throughout your body.

The practical implication is straightforward: the light environment you create in your home, the temperature you maintain, and even when you eat all send signals that either support or fight your body's natural timing. Getting these signals aligned makes falling asleep easier, improves sleep quality, and makes waking up less painful.

## Blue Light and Screens

Blue light (wavelengths around 460-480 nanometers) is the most potent suppressor of melatonin, the hormone that signals your body to prepare for sleep. During the day, blue light is beneficial -- it keeps you alert. The problem is that most screens (phones, tablets, laptops, TVs) emit significant blue light, and using them in the evening tells your brain it is still daytime.

### What You Can Do

- **Set devices to night mode after sunset.** Both iOS (Night Shift) and Android (Night Light) can be scheduled to reduce blue light automatically. On computers, use the built-in Night Light (Windows) or Night Shift (macOS).
- **Stop screen use 60-90 minutes before bed.** This is the most effective single change. If that feels unrealistic, start with 30 minutes and work up.
- **If you must use screens in the evening, use blue-light-blocking glasses.** Look for lenses that block wavelengths below 500 nm (amber or orange tinted). Clear "blue-light" lenses block very little and are mostly marketing.
- **Dim screen brightness in the evening.** Even with night mode on, a screen at full brightness in a dark room still delivers significant light exposure.

## Morning Light Exposure

Getting bright light exposure within 30-60 minutes of waking is one of the most powerful circadian signals you can give your body. It suppresses residual melatonin, boosts cortisol (which you want in the morning), and anchors your circadian clock for the day.

### What You Can Do

- **Open the curtains immediately when you wake up.** Even on a cloudy day, outdoor light is 10-50 times brighter than indoor lighting.
- **Go outside for 10-15 minutes in the morning.** Walk to get coffee, eat breakfast on the porch, or just stand in the yard. Direct sunlight is ideal, but even overcast sky light is effective.
- **If you wake before sunrise or live in a dark climate, use a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp.** Place it about 16-24 inches from your face while you eat breakfast or read. Do not stare directly at it -- just have it in your peripheral vision. Use it for 20-30 minutes.
- **Position your desk or breakfast area near windows.** The more natural light you get during the first half of the day, the stronger your circadian signal.

## Bedroom Temperature

Your body temperature drops by about 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit as part of the sleep initiation process. If your bedroom is too warm, your body struggles to achieve this drop, and falling asleep takes longer. Research consistently identifies an ideal bedroom temperature range.

### What You Can Do

- **Keep the bedroom between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (15-19 degrees Celsius).** This range allows your body to cool naturally.
- **Use breathable bedding materials.** Cotton, linen, and wool regulate temperature far better than polyester. Wool is particularly effective because it wicks moisture and insulates without trapping heat.
- **Consider a warm shower 60-90 minutes before bed.** This sounds counterintuitive, but warming your skin dilates blood vessels, which then rapidly cools your core temperature after you get out -- accelerating the natural pre-sleep temperature drop.
- **Keep feet warm.** Cold extremities signal your body to constrict blood vessels and conserve heat, which fights the core cooling process. Wearing socks to bed or using a hot water bottle at the foot of the bed helps.

## Evening Lighting

The lighting in your home during the 2-3 hours before bed has a major effect on melatonin production. Bright overhead lights, especially those with a cool/daylight color temperature, suppress melatonin almost as effectively as screens.

### What You Can Do

- **Switch to warm-toned bulbs (2700K or lower) in rooms you use in the evening.** Standard LED bulbs are often 4000-5000K, which is essentially daylight color.
- **Use table lamps and floor lamps instead of overhead lights in the evening.** Lower light sources at eye level or below are less stimulating than bright overhead fixtures.
- **Dim your lights in the 1-2 hours before bed.** If you have dimmers, use them. If not, simply turn off the overhead lights and rely on a single table lamp.
- **Use red or amber nightlights for bathroom trips.** Red wavelengths have virtually no effect on melatonin. A small red LED nightlight in the hallway and bathroom allows you to see without disrupting your sleep hormones.

## Meal Timing

Your digestive system has its own circadian clock. Eating late at night -- especially heavy or high-carbohydrate meals -- can shift your peripheral clocks out of sync with your master clock, a state researchers call "circadian misalignment."

### What You Can Do

- **Finish your last substantial meal at least 2-3 hours before bed.** This gives your digestive system time to process the meal before you lie down.
- **If you need a late snack, keep it small and protein-forward.** A handful of nuts, a small piece of cheese, or a spoonful of nut butter. Avoid large portions of carbohydrates late at night.
- **Try to eat meals at consistent times each day.** Regular meal timing reinforces your circadian rhythm.
- **Avoid caffeine after early afternoon.** Caffeine has a half-life of 5-7 hours. A coffee at 3 PM still has half its caffeine in your system at 8-10 PM.

## Putting It All Together

You do not need to implement every suggestion at once. Pick the two or three changes that feel easiest for your lifestyle and start there. The highest-impact changes for most people are:

1. Getting morning light exposure within 30 minutes of waking.
2. Stopping screen use (or at minimum, enabling night mode and dimming) 60 minutes before bed.
3. Keeping the bedroom cool -- 65 degrees Fahrenheit is a good starting point.

These three changes alone can meaningfully improve sleep onset time and sleep quality. Add the others gradually as they become habits.
