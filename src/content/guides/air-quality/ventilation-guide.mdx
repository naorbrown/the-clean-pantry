## Why Ventilation Matters

Modern homes are built tight. Energy codes require air sealing, weatherstripping, and insulated windows that minimize drafts. This is excellent for energy bills but creates a problem: indoor air pollutants have nowhere to go. Carbon dioxide from breathing, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from furniture and cleaning products, moisture from cooking and showering, and particulate matter from cooking all accumulate in a sealed home.

The solution is controlled ventilation -- bringing in fresh outdoor air intentionally rather than relying on random leaks and drafts. The goal is to exchange stale indoor air for fresh outdoor air at a rate that maintains air quality without significantly increasing your heating or cooling costs.

## Understanding Air Changes Per Hour

Air exchange rate is measured in air changes per hour (ACH) -- how many times the entire volume of air in a space is replaced in one hour. Building codes typically recommend 0.35 ACH as a minimum for residential spaces. This means roughly one-third of the air in your home should be replaced with fresh outdoor air every hour.

To put that in perspective, a 1,500 square foot home with 8-foot ceilings has 12,000 cubic feet of air. At 0.35 ACH, you need approximately 4,200 cubic feet of fresh air per hour, or about 70 cubic feet per minute (CFM).

## Types of Ventilation

### Exhaust-Only Ventilation

This is the simplest approach and what most homes already have. Bathroom exhaust fans and kitchen range hoods pull stale air out of the house. Fresh air enters passively through small gaps, cracks, and intentional air inlets. This creates slight negative pressure inside the home.

**Pros:** Inexpensive. Uses equipment you already own.

**Cons:** You have no control over where the makeup air comes from. In a tight home, the replacement air may be drawn through the garage, attic, or crawl space, bringing in fumes, dust, or humidity. Negative pressure can also cause backdrafting in combustion appliances (gas furnaces, water heaters), pulling exhaust gases back into the living space.

**Best for:** Mild climates and older, leakier homes where makeup air enters through many distributed points.

### Supply-Only Ventilation

A fan or duct connected to the HVAC system brings filtered outdoor air into the home. Stale air exits passively through leaks and exhaust points. This creates slight positive pressure.

**Pros:** You control where the air comes from and can filter it before it enters.

**Cons:** In humid climates, pushing outdoor air into wall cavities through small gaps can cause condensation and mold. Positive pressure forces moist air into the building envelope.

**Best for:** Dry climates where outdoor humidity is not a concern.

### Balanced Ventilation (HRV and ERV)

A Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) or Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) simultaneously exhausts stale air and brings in fresh air through a heat exchanger core. The outgoing air transfers its heat (and in the case of an ERV, its moisture) to the incoming air, recovering 70-85% of the energy that would otherwise be lost.

**HRV vs ERV:** An HRV transfers only heat. An ERV transfers both heat and moisture. In cold, dry climates, an HRV is typically preferred because you do not want to retain indoor moisture -- it condenses on cold windows and surfaces. In hot, humid climates, an ERV is preferred because it prevents humid outdoor air from overwhelming your air conditioning.

**Pros:** Energy efficient, provides balanced pressure, controlled air quality.

**Cons:** Higher upfront cost ($1,500-$3,000 installed). Requires ductwork. Needs filter maintenance.

**Best for:** Tight, energy-efficient homes in extreme climates (very cold or very hot and humid).

## Practical Steps for Any Home

### Run Exhaust Fans Properly

- Run the bathroom exhaust fan for 20 minutes after every shower, not just during.
- Run the kitchen range hood every time you cook on the stove, especially with gas burners. Gas stoves produce nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide that need to be vented.
- Check that exhaust fans actually vent to the outside. Some older homes have bathroom fans that exhaust into the attic, which causes moisture damage and does not improve indoor air quality.

### Strategic Window Opening

- Open windows on opposite sides of the home for 10-15 minutes to create cross-ventilation. This is the fastest way to flush indoor air.
- Even in winter, a 10-minute window opening will exchange a significant portion of the room's air without meaningfully affecting your heating bill. The thermal mass of your furniture, walls, and floors retains enough heat to recover quickly.
- Avoid opening windows during high pollen days if allergies are a concern. Check local pollen counts before ventilating.

### Monitor CO2 as a Ventilation Indicator

A portable CO2 monitor (available for $50-$100) is the most practical way to gauge whether your home has adequate ventilation. Outdoor air contains approximately 420 ppm of CO2. Well-ventilated indoor spaces stay below 800 ppm. If your bedroom reads above 1,000 ppm in the morning, you need more ventilation in that room.

### Maintain Your HVAC System

- Replace furnace filters on schedule (every 1-3 months depending on the filter type and household conditions).
- Have ductwork inspected every few years for leaks. Leaky supply ducts dump conditioned air into the attic or crawl space. Leaky return ducts pull contaminated air from those spaces into your living areas.
- Keep supply and return vents unblocked. Do not close vents in unused rooms -- this creates pressure imbalances that increase air leakage through the building envelope.
