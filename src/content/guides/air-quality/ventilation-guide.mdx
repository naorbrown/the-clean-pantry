## Why Ventilation Matters

Modern homes are sealed tight for energy efficiency, but that traps CO2, VOCs, moisture, and cooking particulates indoors. Controlled ventilation brings in fresh air intentionally -- exchanging stale air at a rate that maintains quality without blowing your energy budget.

## Understanding Air Changes Per Hour

Air changes per hour (ACH) measures how many times a space's air volume is fully replaced in one hour. Building codes recommend a 0.35 ACH minimum for homes -- roughly one-third of your air replaced each hour.

For a 1,500 sq ft home with 8-foot ceilings (12,000 cu ft of air), that means about 70 CFM of fresh air.

## Types of Ventilation

### Exhaust-Only Ventilation

Bathroom fans and range hoods pull stale air out. Fresh air enters passively through gaps and cracks, creating slight negative pressure.

**Pros:** Inexpensive. Uses equipment you already own.

**Cons:** No control over where makeup air comes from -- it may be drawn through the garage, attic, or crawl space. Negative pressure can cause backdrafting in gas appliances.

**Best for:** Mild climates and older, leakier homes.

### Supply-Only Ventilation

A fan or duct brings filtered outdoor air in. Stale air exits passively through leaks and exhaust points, creating slight positive pressure.

**Pros:** You control and filter incoming air.

**Cons:** In humid climates, positive pressure forces moist air into wall cavities, causing condensation and mold.

**Best for:** Dry climates.

### Balanced Ventilation (HRV and ERV)

HRVs and ERVs simultaneously exhaust stale air and bring in fresh air through a heat exchanger, recovering 70-85% of the energy.

**HRV vs ERV:** HRVs transfer only heat -- best for cold, dry climates where you want to shed indoor moisture. ERVs transfer heat and moisture -- best for hot, humid climates where you want to keep humid air out.

**Pros:** Energy efficient, balanced pressure, controlled air quality.

**Cons:** $1,500-$3,000 installed. Requires ductwork and filter maintenance.

**Best for:** Tight, energy-efficient homes in extreme climates.

## Practical Steps for Any Home

### Run Exhaust Fans Properly

- Run the bathroom fan for 20 minutes *after* every shower, not just during.
- Run the range hood every time you use the stove, especially gas burners (they produce NO2 and CO).
- Verify fans actually vent outside. Some older homes exhaust into the attic.

### Strategic Window Opening

- Open windows on opposite sides of the home for 10-15 minutes for cross-ventilation -- the fastest way to flush indoor air.
- Even in winter, 10 minutes will not meaningfully affect your heating bill. Thermal mass in walls and furniture recovers quickly.
- Skip this on high-pollen days if allergies are a concern.

### Monitor CO2 as a Ventilation Indicator

A portable CO2 monitor ($50-$100) is the best way to gauge ventilation. Outdoor air sits around 420 ppm. Well-ventilated indoor spaces stay below 800 ppm. If your bedroom reads above 1,000 ppm in the morning, you need more ventilation.

### Maintain Your HVAC System

- Replace furnace filters every 1-3 months.
- Have ductwork inspected every few years. Leaky ducts dump conditioned air into the attic or pull contaminated air into living areas.
- Keep all vents unblocked. Do not close vents in unused rooms -- it creates pressure imbalances that increase air leakage.
