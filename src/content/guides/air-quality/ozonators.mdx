## What Is an Ozonator?

An ozonator, or ozone generator, is a device that produces ozone (O3) -- a highly reactive form of oxygen with three atoms instead of the usual two. When released into a room, ozone molecules react with pollutants, bacteria, mold spores, and odor-causing compounds, breaking them down through oxidation. This chemical reaction can neutralize smells and organic contaminants that other methods leave behind.

Ozone generators come in two main types. Corona discharge models use electrical arcs to split oxygen molecules, which then recombine as ozone. UV ozone generators use ultraviolet light to achieve the same effect but produce less ozone overall, making them better suited for light-duty applications.

## When Ozonators Are Useful

Ozone treatment is effective in specific situations where conventional cleaning falls short:

- **Smoke damage remediation** -- after a fire or in a home purchased from a heavy smoker, ozone can break down tar and nicotine residues embedded in walls, carpets, and furniture.
- **Mold remediation** -- ozone kills mold spores and neutralizes the musty smell that lingers after mold removal. It does not replace physical mold removal but complements it.
- **Vehicle odor removal** -- pet smells, cigarette smoke, and food odors in car interiors respond well to short ozone treatments.
- **Vacant property preparation** -- landlords and real estate professionals use ozone to reset the air in units between tenants.
- **Flood and water damage** -- after water damage is repaired, ozone can address residual bacterial growth and musty odors.

Ozone is not a replacement for daily air purification. It is a remediation tool best used for specific, temporary problems.

## Safety Guidelines

Ozone is a lung irritant and can cause serious health effects at elevated concentrations. Follow these rules without exception:

- **Never run an ozonator with people or pets in the room.** Ozone at concentrations high enough to eliminate odors is harmful to breathe. Remove all living things, including plants, from the treatment area.
- **Ventilate thoroughly after treatment.** Open all windows and run fans for at least 2 hours before re-entering the space. Ozone naturally breaks down back into oxygen (O2) but this takes time.
- **Seal the room during treatment.** Close doors and windows, and cover any gaps under doors with towels to keep the ozone concentrated where it needs to work.
- **Follow the EPA's position.** The EPA has stated that ozone generators are not recommended for use as air purifiers in occupied spaces. Residential use should be limited to unoccupied remediation.

## What to Look for in an Ozonator

If you determine that ozone treatment is appropriate for your situation, choose a unit with the following features:

- **Timer with auto-shutoff** -- set the treatment duration and let the machine turn itself off, so you do not need to re-enter the room to stop it.
- **Adjustable output** -- different room sizes and contamination levels require different ozone concentrations. A variable output dial gives you control.
- **Adequate coverage** -- check the manufacturer's rated square footage. Undersized units will not produce enough ozone to be effective.
- **Corona discharge type** -- for serious remediation work, corona discharge models produce significantly more ozone than UV-based units.

## Ozonators vs Air Purifiers

These are fundamentally different tools. Air purifiers run continuously in occupied rooms, filtering particles and (in some cases) adsorbing gases. Ozone generators treat unoccupied spaces with a reactive gas that chemically destroys contaminants. An air purifier is for ongoing, daily air quality. An ozone generator is for one-time or occasional deep treatment of specific problems. Most homes need an air purifier. Few need an ozone generator -- but when you do, nothing else works quite as well for embedded odors and biological contamination.
