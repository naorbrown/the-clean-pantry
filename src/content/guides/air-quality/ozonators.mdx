## What Is an Ozonator?

An ozonator produces ozone (O3) -- a reactive form of oxygen that breaks down pollutants, bacteria, mold spores, and odor compounds through oxidation. It neutralizes smells and contaminants that other methods leave behind.

Two main types exist. **Corona discharge** models use electrical arcs to produce ozone -- best for serious remediation. **UV ozone generators** produce less ozone and suit lighter-duty applications.

## When Ozonators Are Useful

Ozone treatment works when conventional cleaning falls short:

- **Smoke damage** -- breaks down tar and nicotine in walls, carpets, and furniture
- **Mold remediation** -- kills spores and neutralizes musty smell (complements physical removal)
- **Vehicle odors** -- pet smells, cigarette smoke, and food odors in car interiors
- **Vacant property prep** -- resets air in rental units between tenants
- **Post-flood cleanup** -- addresses residual bacteria and musty odors after repairs

Ozone is a remediation tool for specific, temporary problems -- not a replacement for daily air purification.

## Safety Guidelines

Ozone is a lung irritant at effective concentrations. Follow these rules without exception:

- **Never run with people or pets present.** Remove all living things, including plants, from the treatment area.
- **Ventilate after treatment.** Open all windows and run fans for at least 2 hours before re-entering.
- **Seal the room during treatment.** Close doors and windows; cover gaps under doors with towels.
- **Follow the EPA's position.** Ozone generators are not recommended for occupied spaces. Use only for unoccupied remediation.

## What to Look for in an Ozonator

Choose a unit with these features:

- **Timer with auto-shutoff** -- no need to re-enter the room to stop it
- **Adjustable output** -- match ozone concentration to room size and contamination level
- **Adequate coverage** -- check the rated square footage; undersized units will not work
- **Corona discharge type** -- produces far more ozone than UV models for serious remediation

## Ozonators vs Air Purifiers

These are fundamentally different tools. Air purifiers run continuously in occupied rooms, filtering particles and adsorbing gases. Ozone generators treat unoccupied spaces with a reactive gas that chemically destroys contaminants. Most homes need an air purifier. Few need an ozone generator -- but when you do, nothing else matches it for embedded odors and biological contamination.
