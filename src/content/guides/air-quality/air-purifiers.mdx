## The Four Main Technologies

Air purifiers use different mechanisms to clean indoor air. Understanding what each technology actually removes is the key to choosing the right one for your home.

### HEPA Filters

HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are the gold standard for particle removal. A true HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns and larger. This includes dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and many bacteria. HEPA filters are mechanical -- air passes through a dense mat of fibers, and particles get trapped physically. They do not produce any byproducts or chemicals.

HEPA filters do not remove gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or odors. They only capture solid particles.

### Activated Carbon Filters

Activated carbon (also called activated charcoal) adsorbs gases and volatile organic compounds onto its porous surface. This makes it effective against odors, smoke, formaldehyde off-gassing from furniture, and chemical fumes. Carbon filters are often paired with HEPA filters in the same unit, which is the ideal combination for comprehensive air cleaning.

The main drawback is that carbon filters become saturated over time and must be replaced regularly to remain effective. A saturated carbon filter does nothing.

### Ionizers

Ionizers release negative ions into the air, which attach to airborne particles and cause them to settle onto surfaces. Some models use electrostatic precipitator plates to collect the charged particles. The problem with ionizers is that many produce ozone as a byproduct, which is a lung irritant. Even models marketed as "ozone-free" may produce trace amounts. Additionally, settled particles are not truly removed -- they sit on your walls, floors, and furniture until you clean them up.

### UV-C Light

UV-C purifiers use ultraviolet light to kill or inactivate bacteria, viruses, and mold spores that pass through the light chamber. UV-C is effective against biological contaminants but does nothing for dust, allergens, gases, or odors. Most standalone UV-C purifiers do not expose air to the light long enough for thorough disinfection. UV-C works best as a supplementary feature inside a HEPA unit, not as a primary technology.

## What to Actually Buy

For most homes, a **HEPA purifier with an activated carbon pre-filter** is the best general-purpose choice. This combination handles both particles and gases. Here is how to size it correctly:

### Room Size Calculation

Every air purifier has a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), measured in cubic feet per minute. To properly clean a room, the purifier should cycle all the air in the room at least 4-5 times per hour.

- Measure your room's square footage.
- The purifier's recommended room size (listed by the manufacturer) should match or exceed your room.
- For rooms with high ceilings (over 8 feet), size up. A unit rated for 300 sq ft at standard ceiling height will underperform in a room with 12-foot ceilings.

### Filter Replacement Costs

The purchase price is only part of the cost. Factor in ongoing filter replacement:

- **HEPA filters** typically last 12 months and cost $30-$80 to replace.
- **Carbon filters** last 3-6 months and cost $15-$40.
- **Pre-filters** (the mesh screen that catches large particles) can often be vacuumed and reused, extending the HEPA filter's life.

Before buying, check the manufacturer's replacement filter prices. Some brands charge premium prices for proprietary filters.

## What to Avoid

- **Ionizers that produce ozone.** Check the California Air Resources Board (CARB) certified list. If the unit is not on it, it may produce unsafe ozone levels.
- **Units with only UV-C.** UV-C alone is not sufficient for general air purification.
- **Marketing claims like "removes 99.99% of everything."** Look for independently tested CADR ratings instead of vague marketing.
- **Units without replaceable filters.** "Permanent filter" models are less effective than true HEPA and cannot be restored to original performance.

## Placement Tips

- Place the purifier in the room where you spend the most time, typically the bedroom.
- Keep it at least a foot away from walls and furniture so air can flow freely.
- Close windows and doors in the room to let the purifier cycle all the air, rather than constantly pulling in new outdoor air.
- Run it on a medium or high setting when you are out of the room, and drop to a lower setting for sleeping if noise is a concern.
