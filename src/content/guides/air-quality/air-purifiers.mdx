## The Four Main Technologies

### HEPA Filters

The gold standard for particle removal. A true HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns and larger -- dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and many bacteria. HEPA is mechanical: air passes through dense fibers and particles get trapped. No byproducts.

HEPA does not remove gases, VOCs, or odors -- only solid particles.

### Activated Carbon Filters

Activated carbon adsorbs gases and VOCs onto its porous surface. Effective against odors, smoke, formaldehyde off-gassing, and chemical fumes. Often paired with HEPA for comprehensive air cleaning.

Carbon filters become saturated over time and must be replaced regularly. A saturated filter does nothing.

### Ionizers

Ionizers release negative ions that attach to particles and cause them to settle onto surfaces. The problem: many produce ozone as a byproduct. Even "ozone-free" models may produce trace amounts. Settled particles are not truly removed -- they sit on walls, floors, and furniture until you clean them.

### UV-C Light

UV-C light kills bacteria, viruses, and mold spores in a light chamber. Does nothing for dust, allergens, gases, or odors. Most standalone units do not expose air long enough for thorough disinfection. UV-C works best as a supplement inside a HEPA unit, not as a primary technology.

## What to Actually Buy

For most homes, a **HEPA purifier with an activated carbon pre-filter** is the best choice. It handles both particles and gases.

### Room Size Calculation

Every air purifier has a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) in cubic feet per minute. The purifier should cycle all room air 4-5 times per hour.

- Match the purifier's rated room size to your room or go larger.
- High ceilings (over 8 feet) require sizing up.

### Filter Replacement Costs

Factor in ongoing filter replacement -- not just the purchase price:

- **HEPA filters:** 12 months, $30-$80
- **Carbon filters:** 3-6 months, $15-$40
- **Pre-filters:** often vacuumed and reused, extending the HEPA filter's life

Check replacement filter prices before buying. Some brands charge premiums for proprietary filters.

## What to Avoid

- **Ozone-producing ionizers.** Check the CARB certified list. Unlisted units may produce unsafe ozone.
- **UV-C-only units.** UV-C alone is insufficient for general air purification.
- **Vague marketing claims.** Look for independently tested CADR ratings, not "removes 99.99% of everything."
- **"Permanent filter" models.** Less effective than true HEPA and cannot be restored to original performance.

## Placement Tips

- Place it where you spend the most time -- usually the bedroom.
- Keep at least a foot of clearance from walls and furniture.
- Close windows and doors so the purifier cycles room air instead of pulling in outdoor air.
- Run higher when you are out; lower at night if noise is a concern.
