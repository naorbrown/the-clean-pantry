## What MERV Ratings Mean

MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) rates HVAC filters from 1-20. Higher numbers catch smaller particles.

- **MERV 1-4** -- Large particles only: dust bunnies, carpet fibers, pollen over 10 microns. These flat fiberglass panels protect the equipment more than you.
- **MERV 5-8** -- Mold spores, dust mite debris, hair spray. A reasonable minimum for any home.
- **MERV 9-12** -- Fine dust, lead dust, auto emissions. The sweet spot for most homes. Removes most allergens without restricting airflow.
- **MERV 13-16** -- Bacteria, tobacco smoke, particles down to 0.3 microns. MERV 13 is the max most residential systems handle. Approaches HEPA.
- **MERV 17-20** -- True HEPA. Hospitals and clean rooms only. Not compatible with standard home HVAC.

## Recommended Rating for Homes

**MERV 10-13** is ideal for most homes -- captures the majority of allergens while allowing adequate airflow.

Before installing a higher-rated filter, check two things:

1. **Static pressure tolerance.** A filter that is too dense starves the system of airflow, forcing it to work harder and potentially freezing the evaporator coil.
2. **Return duct size.** Undersized ductwork cannot handle dense filters. Stick with MERV 10 or lower if ducts are small.

If unsure, start with a MERV 11 pleated filter. If the blower runs louder or your home heats/cools slowly, step down to MERV 8.

## Fiberglass vs Pleated Filters

**Fiberglass filters** ($1-$3 each) are flat, thin, and rated MERV 1-4. They protect the equipment but do very little for air quality.

**Pleated filters** ($10-$25 each) use folded synthetic media with far more surface area. Available from MERV 5-16, they catch finer particles without choking airflow. Worth the upgrade for any home where air quality matters.

## How Often to Change Your Filter

The interval depends on your household:

- **Every 30 days** -- multiple pets, allergies/asthma, or high-pollen/dust areas
- **Every 60 days** -- one pet or moderate dust
- **Every 90 days** -- no pets, average conditions
- **Check monthly regardless** -- hold it to a light. If you cannot see through it, replace it.

A dirty filter is worse than a low-rated clean one. It restricts airflow, raises energy bills, and can cause equipment failure.

## Signs Your Filter Needs Changing

- Dust accumulating faster than usual
- Reduced airflow from vents
- Longer HVAC cycles to reach set temperature
- Musty or stale smell when the system runs
- Visible dust or discoloration on the filter
- Increased allergy symptoms

## Tips

- Write the install date on the filter frame with a marker.
- Buy multi-packs so a replacement is always on hand.
- Point the airflow arrow toward the blower (toward the furnace, away from the return duct).
- If your system has both a furnace filter and a return grille filter, change both on the same schedule.
