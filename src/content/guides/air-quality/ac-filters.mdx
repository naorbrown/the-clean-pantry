## What MERV Ratings Mean

MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value, and it is the standard rating system for HVAC air filters. The scale runs from 1 to 20, and higher numbers mean the filter catches smaller particles. Here is what each range actually captures:

- **MERV 1-4** -- Catches large particles only: dust bunnies, carpet fibers, pollen grains over 10 microns. These are the flat fiberglass panel filters that come installed in most systems. They protect the equipment more than they protect you.
- **MERV 5-8** -- Catches mold spores, hair spray, cement dust, and dust mite debris. A noticeable improvement over basic filters, and a reasonable minimum for any home.
- **MERV 9-12** -- Catches fine dust, legionella bacteria, lead dust, and auto emission particles. This is the sweet spot for most residential systems. A MERV 11 or 12 filter removes the majority of common household allergens without restricting airflow.
- **MERV 13-16** -- Catches bacteria, tobacco smoke, sneeze droplets, and particles down to 0.3 microns. MERV 13 is the highest rating most residential systems can handle without modification. It approaches HEPA-level filtration.
- **MERV 17-20** -- True HEPA territory. These filters are used in hospitals, clean rooms, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. They require powerful blowers and are not compatible with standard home HVAC systems.

## Recommended Rating for Homes

**MERV 10-13** is the ideal range for most residential HVAC systems. This range captures the vast majority of allergens, dust, and airborne irritants while still allowing adequate airflow through your system.

Before installing a higher-rated filter, check two things:

1. **Your system's static pressure tolerance.** Every HVAC system has a maximum amount of resistance it can push air through. A filter that is too dense will starve the system of airflow, causing it to work harder, run longer, and potentially freeze the evaporator coil.
2. **Your return duct size.** Larger return ducts can accommodate denser filters more easily. If your home has undersized ductwork, stick with MERV 10 or lower.

If you are unsure, start with a MERV 11 pleated filter and monitor your system. If the blower runs louder or your home takes longer to reach temperature, step down to a MERV 8.

## Fiberglass vs Pleated Filters

**Fiberglass filters** are the cheapest option (typically $1-$3 each). They are flat, thin, and rated MERV 1-4. Their job is to keep large debris out of your blower motor and coils. They do very little for indoor air quality.

**Pleated filters** use folded synthetic media that creates a much larger surface area within the same frame size. This allows them to catch finer particles without choking off airflow. Pleated filters are available from MERV 5 all the way up to MERV 16. They cost $10-$25 each but are significantly more effective. For any home where air quality matters, pleated filters are worth the added cost.

## How Often to Change Your Filter

The correct interval depends on your household conditions:

- **Every 30 days** -- if you have multiple pets, someone in the home has allergies or asthma, or you live in a high-pollen or high-dust area.
- **Every 60 days** -- if you have one pet or moderate dust levels.
- **Every 90 days** -- standard recommendation for homes without pets and average conditions.
- **Check monthly regardless** -- pull the filter out and hold it up to a light source. If you cannot see light through it, replace it regardless of how long it has been.

Running a dirty filter is worse than running a low-rated clean filter. A clogged filter restricts airflow, forces your system to work harder, increases energy bills, and can lead to equipment failure.

## Signs Your Filter Needs Changing

- Dust accumulating on surfaces faster than usual
- Reduced airflow from vents (hold your hand near a register to check)
- HVAC system running longer cycles to reach the set temperature
- Unusual musty or stale smell when the system runs
- Visible dust or discoloration on the filter media
- Increased allergy symptoms among household members

## Tips

- Write the installation date on the filter frame with a marker so you always know how old it is.
- Buy filters in multi-packs to save money and ensure you always have a replacement on hand.
- Make sure the airflow arrow on the filter frame points toward the blower (toward the furnace or air handler, away from the return duct).
- If your system has both a furnace filter and a return grille filter, change both on the same schedule.
