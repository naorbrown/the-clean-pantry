## What VOCs Are and Why They Matter

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals that evaporate at room temperature, releasing gases into the air you breathe. Conventional interior paints are a significant source of VOC exposure. Formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and ethylene glycol are among the VOCs commonly found in standard paints, primers, and stains. These compounds are responsible for the strong smell of fresh paint and can cause headaches, dizziness, eye irritation, and respiratory issues during and after application.

The off-gassing period is most intense during the first 48-72 hours but continues at lower levels for weeks or months. In poorly ventilated rooms, VOC concentrations can be 2-5 times higher than outdoor levels during painting and remain elevated long after the paint appears dry.

## Understanding Paint Labels

### VOC Content Ratings

VOC content is measured in grams per liter (g/L). The federal limit for flat interior paint is 250 g/L, but that number is quite high from a health standpoint.

- **Conventional paint:** 150-250 g/L
- **Low-VOC paint:** Under 50 g/L (the industry threshold for the "low-VOC" label)
- **Zero-VOC paint:** Under 5 g/L (trace amounts may still be present)

The lower the number, the fewer volatile compounds are released. Zero-VOC paints have improved dramatically in quality and are now comparable to conventional paint in coverage and durability.

### Certifications to Look For

- **GREENGUARD Gold** -- tests the actual emissions from the dried paint film, not just the contents of the can. This is the most meaningful certification for indoor air quality.
- **MPI Green Performance Standard** -- verifies low emissions and environmental criteria.

Be cautious about the "low-VOC" label alone. Some paints meet the threshold but still contain other harmful chemicals. The tinting process can also add VOCs -- a base paint labeled zero-VOC may have higher VOC levels once tinted with conventional colorants. Ask for zero-VOC tints specifically.

## Choosing Safer Paint

### What to Avoid

- **Alkyd (oil-based) paints.** These have the highest VOC levels and require solvent-based cleanup (mineral spirits), adding more chemical exposure. There is rarely a reason to use oil-based paint indoors in a modern home.
- **Antimicrobial or mildew-resistant additives.** These often contain biocides that continue releasing into room air. Use proper ventilation to prevent mold instead of relying on chemical additives in paint.
- **Vinyl and PVC-based paints.** Some budget paints use vinyl acrylic binders that off-gas plasticizers.

### What to Choose

- **Zero-VOC latex paint with mineral pigments.** The safest widely available option. Major manufacturers now offer zero-VOC lines with excellent performance.
- **Natural paints.** Made from plant oils, natural resins, mineral pigments, and clay. Brands in this category use ingredients like linseed oil, citrus oil solvents, and chalk. They have a distinctive mild scent that is not chemical-based and dissipates quickly. Coverage may require an extra coat compared to conventional paint.
- **Milk paint.** Made from milk protein (casein), lime, and earth pigments. Completely non-toxic and ancient in origin. Best for furniture, accent walls, and decorative finishes. It produces a distinctive matte, slightly chalky finish.

## Safe Renovation Practices

### During Painting

- **Ventilate aggressively.** Open all windows in the room and create cross-ventilation with fans. Continue ventilating for at least 72 hours after painting.
- **Wear a respirator**, even with low-VOC paint. A simple N95 mask does not filter VOCs -- use a half-face respirator with organic vapor cartridges for any extended painting session.
- **Keep children and pregnant women out of freshly painted rooms** for at least 48-72 hours, and longer if you can still detect a paint smell.
- **Do not sleep in a freshly painted room** for at least 3-5 days. VOC concentrations peak in enclosed rooms with poor ventilation.

### Lead Paint in Older Homes

Any home built before 1978 may contain lead paint. Sanding, scraping, or disturbing old paint layers can release lead dust, which is extremely hazardous -- especially for children.

- **Test before disturbing.** Lead test kits are available at hardware stores and give results in minutes.
- **If lead is present,** do not sand or scrape it yourself. Hire an EPA-certified lead abatement contractor. This is not a cost-saving area.
- **Encapsulation** (painting over intact lead paint with a specialized encapsulant) is a valid alternative to removal when the existing paint is in good condition and not peeling.

### Other Renovation Exposures

Paint is not the only source of chemical exposure during renovations. Watch for:

- **Adhesives and caulks.** Choose low-VOC or solvent-free formulations.
- **Polyurethane floor finishes.** Water-based polyurethane has significantly lower VOC levels than oil-based. Even better, consider hard wax oil finishes, which use plant-based oils and have minimal off-gassing.
- **Dust.** Any demolition or sanding creates particulate matter. Seal off the work area with plastic sheeting and use a HEPA air purifier during and after the work.
- **New carpet and pad.** Synthetic carpet off-gasses significantly. If possible, choose natural fiber carpet or hard flooring and allow new carpet to air out in a garage or covered outdoor space before installation.
