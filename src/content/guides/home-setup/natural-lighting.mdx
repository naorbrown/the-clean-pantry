## Circadian Rhythm and Light

Your body's internal clock -- the circadian rhythm -- is regulated primarily by light exposure. Bright, blue-rich light in the morning tells your brain it is daytime, suppressing melatonin and promoting alertness. As the sun sets and light shifts warmer and dimmer, your brain begins producing melatonin to prepare for sleep.

Modern indoor lighting often disrupts this cycle. We spend most of our time indoors under artificial light that does not change throughout the day. The result is weaker circadian signaling, which can contribute to poor sleep, low daytime energy, and long-term health effects.

The goal is not to avoid artificial light entirely. It is to make your home lighting work with your biology instead of against it.

## Blue Light from LEDs and Screens

Standard white LEDs produce a significant spike in the blue wavelength range (around 450-490 nm). This is the same range that most strongly suppresses melatonin production. During the day, this is fine -- even beneficial. The problem is at night.

Evening exposure to blue-rich light from overhead LEDs, phone screens, computer monitors, and televisions delays melatonin onset and shifts your circadian rhythm later. Research has consistently shown that even moderate blue light exposure in the 2 hours before bedtime can reduce sleep quality and make it harder to fall asleep.

Practical steps to reduce evening blue light:

- Switch to warm-toned bulbs (2700K or lower) in living rooms and bedrooms.
- Use night mode or blue light filter settings on phones and computers after sunset.
- Dim overhead lights in the evening. Lower intensity matters as much as color temperature.
- Consider blue-blocking glasses if you need to use screens late at night.

## Full-Spectrum Bulbs

Full-spectrum bulbs are designed to mimic the spectral distribution of natural sunlight, including wavelengths across the visible spectrum rather than the narrow peaks of standard LEDs. They are useful in rooms where you spend daytime hours -- home offices, kitchens, and studios.

Look for bulbs labeled "full spectrum" with a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 95 or higher. A high CRI means colors appear more natural under the light, which reduces eye strain and creates a more pleasant environment. Standard LEDs typically have a CRI around 80.

Use full-spectrum bulbs in task lighting and overhead fixtures for daytime spaces. Do not use them in bedrooms or evening areas -- their blue content will work against your sleep.

## Warm Light for Evening

For rooms used primarily in the evening -- bedrooms, living rooms, and hallways -- choose bulbs rated at 2700K or lower. The lower the Kelvin number, the warmer (more orange/red) the light.

- **2700K** -- warm white, similar to a traditional incandescent bulb. Good for living rooms.
- **2200K** -- extra warm, similar to candlelight. Good for bedrooms.
- **Amber/red night lights** -- for hallways and bathrooms used at night, amber or red LED night lights have virtually no blue content and will not disrupt melatonin production if you get up during the night.

## Maximizing Natural Daylight

Before buying new bulbs, make the most of the sunlight you already have.

- **Clean your windows.** Dirty glass blocks a surprising amount of light. Clean windows inside and out at least twice a year.
- **Use mirrors strategically.** A large mirror placed on a wall opposite a window effectively doubles the light entering from that direction.
- **Choose light paint colors.** White and light-colored walls reflect natural light deeper into rooms. Dark walls absorb it.
- **Keep window treatments open during the day.** Sheer curtains filter light without blocking it entirely.
- **Trim outdoor vegetation** that blocks windows, if possible. A tree branch covering a south-facing window can significantly reduce indoor light levels.

## Bulb Types: A Health Comparison

**Incandescent bulbs** produce a smooth, full spectrum weighted toward warm tones. They are the closest match to firelight and are excellent for evening use. Their drawback is energy inefficiency -- most of the energy becomes heat. They are being phased out in many places.

**Halogen bulbs** are a type of incandescent that runs hotter and slightly more efficiently. They produce excellent color quality (CRI near 100) and a warm spectrum. They are a good option where available but also generate significant heat.

**LED bulbs** are energy efficient and long-lasting but vary enormously in quality. Cheap LEDs often have poor CRI and an aggressive blue spike. High-quality LEDs with CRI 95+ and adjustable color temperature are the best all-around option for most homes.

**Fluorescent bulbs (including CFLs)** are best avoided. They flicker at a frequency that some people find irritating or headache-inducing. They contain mercury, which is hazardous if broken. And their spectral output is uneven, with narrow spikes rather than a smooth distribution. If you currently have fluorescent tubes in your home, replacing them with high-CRI LEDs is a worthwhile upgrade.
