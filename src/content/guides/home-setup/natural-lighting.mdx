## Circadian Rhythm and Light

Your circadian rhythm is driven by light. Bright morning light suppresses melatonin and promotes alertness. Warm evening light triggers melatonin production for sleep.

Most indoor lighting disrupts this cycle by staying the same color and intensity all day. The goal is to make your home lighting work with your biology, not against it.

## Blue Light from LEDs and Screens

Standard white LEDs spike in the blue wavelength range (450-490 nm) -- the range that most suppresses melatonin. Daytime, that's fine. At night, it delays sleep onset and reduces sleep quality.

Steps to reduce evening blue light:

- Switch to warm-toned bulbs (2700K or lower) in living rooms and bedrooms.
- Use night mode or blue light filter settings on phones and computers after sunset.
- Dim overhead lights in the evening. Lower intensity matters as much as color temperature.
- Consider blue-blocking glasses if you need to use screens late at night.

## Full-Spectrum Bulbs

Full-spectrum bulbs mimic natural sunlight across the visible spectrum, unlike standard LEDs with narrow peaks. Best for daytime rooms: home offices, kitchens, studios.

Look for CRI 95 or higher. High CRI means more natural color rendering, less eye strain. Standard LEDs sit around CRI 80.

Use full-spectrum bulbs for daytime task lighting. Avoid them in bedrooms or evening spaces -- their blue content works against sleep.

## Warm Light for Evening

For evening rooms -- bedrooms, living rooms, hallways -- choose bulbs at 2700K or lower. Lower Kelvin = warmer light.

- **2700K** -- warm white, similar to a traditional incandescent bulb. Good for living rooms.
- **2200K** -- extra warm, similar to candlelight. Good for bedrooms.
- **Amber/red night lights** -- for hallways and bathrooms used at night, amber or red LED night lights have virtually no blue content and will not disrupt melatonin production if you get up during the night.

## Maximizing Natural Daylight

Before buying new bulbs, maximize the sunlight you already have.

- **Clean your windows** inside and out at least twice a year. Dirty glass blocks more light than you'd expect.
- **Place mirrors opposite windows.** A large mirror effectively doubles the light from that direction.
- **Use light paint colors.** White and light walls reflect daylight deeper into rooms.
- **Keep window treatments open during the day.** Sheer curtains filter without blocking.
- **Trim vegetation blocking windows.** A branch over a south-facing window significantly reduces indoor light.

## Bulb Types: A Health Comparison

**Incandescent bulbs** produce a smooth, warm full spectrum -- closest to firelight. Excellent for evening use but energy-inefficient and being phased out.

**Halogen bulbs** are a more efficient incandescent with excellent color quality (CRI near 100). Good where available, but generate significant heat.

**LED bulbs** vary enormously. Cheap LEDs have poor CRI and aggressive blue spikes. High-quality LEDs with CRI 95+ and adjustable color temperature are the best all-around choice.

**Fluorescent bulbs (including CFLs)** are best avoided. They flicker at irritating frequencies, contain mercury, and have uneven spectral output. Replace fluorescent tubes with high-CRI LEDs.
