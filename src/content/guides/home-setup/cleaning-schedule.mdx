## The Principle: Keep It Simple

The whole point of making your own cleaning products is to simplify, not to create more work. This schedule is designed to be minimal and maintainable. You do not need a different product for every surface, and you do not need to deep clean every week. A small amount of consistent effort keeps your home clean without turning it into a second job.

All of the products referenced below can be made from a handful of pantry ingredients -- vinegar, baking soda, castile soap, and water cover the vast majority of tasks.

## Daily Tasks (5-10 Minutes)

These tasks prevent buildup and keep your home baseline clean.

- **Wipe kitchen counters and stovetop** after cooking with your all-purpose cleaner (vinegar and water, or castile soap spray). This takes 2 minutes and prevents grease from hardening.
- **Do the dishes.** Whether by hand or in the dishwasher, do not let them accumulate. Dirty dishes are the single fastest way for a kitchen to look and smell dirty.
- **Wipe the bathroom sink** after morning use. A quick pass with a damp cloth keeps soap scum from building up.
- **Spot-clean spills immediately.** A fresh spill takes seconds to clean. A dried one takes scrubbing. Your stain remover (hydrogen peroxide and dish soap) handles most food and drink spills on fabric.

## Weekly Tasks (30-45 Minutes Total)

Pick a day -- whatever works for your schedule -- and work through these once a week.

- **Bathroom scrub.** Use your tub and shower scrub (baking soda and castile soap paste) on the tub, shower walls, and sink. Apply the toilet bowl cleaner (vinegar and baking soda), let it sit for 10 minutes, scrub, and flush. Wipe the mirror with your glass and mirror spray. The whole bathroom takes 15 minutes.
- **Floors.** Sweep or vacuum all hard floors, then mop with your hardwood and tile cleaner (vinegar and water with a few drops of castile soap). For homes with carpet, vacuum high-traffic areas weekly.
- **Laundry.** Run your weekly loads using your liquid laundry detergent. Treat any stains with your stain remover before washing. Add your fabric softener (vinegar-based) to the rinse cycle.
- **Kitchen surfaces.** Wipe down cabinet fronts, the outside of appliances, and the sink with your all-purpose cleaner. Use the degreaser (baking soda and castile soap) on the stovetop and range hood if there is grease buildup.
- **Dust.** Wipe shelves, windowsills, and ceiling fan blades with a damp microfiber cloth. No product needed -- the damp cloth traps dust rather than pushing it around.

## Monthly Tasks (1-2 Hours, Split Across the Month)

These are deeper cleans that do not need to happen every week. Spread them out -- do one or two per weekend.

- **Oven cleaning.** Apply your oven cleaner (baking soda paste), let it sit overnight, and wipe clean the next day. This requires almost no active effort -- the baking soda does the work.
- **Deep clean the refrigerator.** Remove everything, toss expired items, wipe all shelves and drawers with a baking soda and water solution (2 tablespoons baking soda per quart of warm water). This also eliminates odors.
- **Dust ceiling fans, light fixtures, and vents.** These collect dust that recirculates through your air. A damp cloth or microfiber duster works well.
- **Wash throw blankets, pillow covers, and curtains.** These accumulate dust, pet dander, and allergens. Use your laundry detergent on a gentle cycle.
- **Clean door handles and light switches.** High-touch surfaces that are easy to forget. Wipe with your all-purpose cleaner.

## Seasonal Tasks (Once Every 3 Months)

- **Windows.** Clean all windows inside and out with your glass and mirror spray and a squeegee or lint-free cloth. Clean windows make a noticeable difference in how much natural light enters your home.
- **Carpet freshener treatment.** Sprinkle your carpet freshener (baking soda with essential oils) across all carpets, let it sit for 30 minutes, and vacuum thoroughly. This lifts odors from carpet fibers.
- **Mattress refresh.** Strip the bed and sprinkle a thin layer of plain baking soda over the entire mattress surface. Let it sit for 1-2 hours (or all day if you can), then vacuum it up. This absorbs moisture and neutralizes odors.
- **Deep clean behind and under appliances.** Pull out the refrigerator, stove, and washer/dryer to sweep and mop underneath. Dust and food debris accumulate in these hidden spots.
- **Check and replace cleaning supplies.** Assess your stock of vinegar, baking soda, castile soap, and spray bottles. Batch-make any products that are running low so you are not caught without what you need.

## Keeping It Sustainable

The most effective cleaning schedule is one you actually follow. If this list feels like too much, cut it in half and do the basics: daily counter wipes, weekly bathroom and floors, monthly oven and fridge. That alone keeps a home in good shape.

The simplicity of DIY cleaning products is an advantage here. You are not managing 15 different commercial bottles with different instructions. A bottle of all-purpose cleaner, a tub scrub, and a box of baking soda handle the majority of tasks on this list.
