## The Principle: Keep It Simple

DIY cleaning should simplify your life, not complicate it. This schedule is minimal and maintainable. Consistent small effort beats sporadic deep cleans.

Every product referenced below comes from a handful of pantry ingredients: vinegar, baking soda, castile soap, and water.

## Daily Tasks (5-10 Minutes)

Prevent buildup with these daily habits:

- **Wipe kitchen counters and stovetop** after cooking. Two minutes prevents grease from hardening.
- **Do the dishes.** Don't let them accumulate -- the fastest way a kitchen turns dirty.
- **Wipe the bathroom sink** after morning use to prevent soap scum.
- **Spot-clean spills immediately.** A fresh spill takes seconds; a dried one takes scrubbing.

## Weekly Tasks (30-45 Minutes Total)

Pick one day and work through these.

- **Bathroom scrub.** Baking soda and castile soap paste on tub, shower, and sink. Vinegar and baking soda in the toilet, sit 10 minutes, scrub, flush. Wipe the mirror. Whole bathroom: 15 minutes.
- **Floors.** Sweep or vacuum hard floors, then mop with vinegar water and a few drops of castile soap. Vacuum carpet in high-traffic areas.
- **Laundry.** Treat stains before washing. Add vinegar to the rinse cycle as softener.
- **Kitchen surfaces.** Wipe cabinet fronts, appliance exteriors, and sink. Degrease stovetop and range hood with baking soda and castile soap.
- **Dust.** Damp microfiber cloth on shelves, windowsills, and fan blades. No product needed.

## Monthly Tasks (1-2 Hours, Split Across the Month)

Deeper cleans that don't need to happen weekly. Do one or two per weekend.

- **Oven.** Baking soda paste overnight, wipe clean the next day.
- **Refrigerator.** Remove everything, toss expired items, wipe shelves with baking soda solution (2 tbsp per quart warm water).
- **Ceiling fans, light fixtures, and vents.** Dust with a damp cloth or microfiber duster.
- **Throw blankets, pillow covers, and curtains.** Gentle cycle to clear accumulated dust and allergens.
- **Door handles and light switches.** High-touch surfaces -- wipe with all-purpose cleaner.

## Seasonal Tasks (Once Every 3 Months)

- **Windows.** Clean inside and out with glass spray and a squeegee. Noticeably improves natural light.
- **Carpet freshener.** Baking soda with essential oils, sit 30 minutes, vacuum thoroughly.
- **Mattress refresh.** Sprinkle baking soda over the surface, sit 1-2 hours, vacuum. Absorbs moisture and odors.
- **Behind appliances.** Pull out fridge, stove, washer/dryer and sweep underneath.
- **Restock supplies.** Check vinegar, baking soda, castile soap, and spray bottles. Batch-make anything running low.

## Keeping It Sustainable

The best cleaning schedule is one you actually follow. If this feels like too much, do the basics: daily counter wipes, weekly bathroom and floors, monthly oven and fridge.

One all-purpose cleaner, one tub scrub, and a box of baking soda handle most tasks on this list.
