## What Are EMFs

Two types of EMFs matter at home:

- **Radiofrequency (RF)** -- from WiFi routers, cell phones, Bluetooth, baby monitors, and smart devices.
- **Extremely low frequency (ELF)** -- from household wiring, power lines, and AC appliances.

Both decrease rapidly with distance. **Distance is your best tool.** Doubling your distance from a source cuts exposure by roughly 75%. Most steps below apply this principle.

## Simple Steps to Reduce Exposure

Low-effort changes, no special equipment needed.

### WiFi and Wireless Devices

- **Turn off WiFi at night.** An outlet timer automates this. Eliminates 6-8 hours of continuous RF daily.
- **Use wired ethernet when possible.** Desktop, smart TV, gaming console -- all work better wired anyway.
- **Keep your phone away from your body.** Use a bag or desk, not your pocket. Charge across the room at night, not on the nightstand.
- **Use speakerphone or wired headphones for calls.** Bluetooth headphones also emit RF, though at much lower power than a phone.
- **Disable WiFi and Bluetooth when not in use.** Devices constantly scan for connections even when idle.

### Bedroom Environment

You spend 7-9 concentrated hours in the bedroom every night.

- **Move all wireless devices at least 6 feet away**, or out of the room entirely.
- **Avoid electric blankets.** They generate ELF fields against your body for hours. Use wool or down instead.
- **Unplug unnecessary electronics.** Alarm clocks and chargers generate small ELF fields. Easy to address.
- **Check what's behind your bedroom wall.** If the WiFi router, smart meter, or electrical panel is on the other side, consider moving the bed.

### General Home

- **Position the router away from occupied areas.** Not in bedrooms, at your desk, or next to the couch. A hallway, utility closet, or high shelf is better.
- **Reduce wireless devices.** Ask whether each smart device genuinely needs to be wireless. Wired alternatives exist for many.
- **Keep distance from running appliances.** Step back from the microwave, hair dryer, dishwasher, and washer/dryer during operation.

## Dirty Electricity

Dirty electricity is high-frequency voltage transients on your home's wiring, generated by dimmer switches, some LED bulbs, variable-speed motors, and solar inverters.

Dirty electricity filters plug into outlets to absorb these transients. A reasonable step for those who want to go further, but not essential. Address distance-based strategies first.

A microsurge meter (Stetzerizer or similar) measures noise levels and identifies which outlets benefit most from filtering.

## Perspective: Reasonable Precautions, Not Fear

The science on non-ionizing EMFs at household levels is not settled. Major health organizations consider typical exposure safe; some independent research suggests biological effects at chronic low levels.

These steps follow the precautionary principle: simple, low-cost actions that reduce exposure without lifestyle disruption. Turning off WiFi at night costs nothing. Wired headphones are a minor habit change.

If reducing EMF exposure causes you stress, the stress is likely worse than the exposure. Take the easy steps, skip what feels burdensome.
