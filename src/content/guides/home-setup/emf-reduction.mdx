## What Are EMFs

Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are invisible areas of energy produced by electrically charged objects. In your home, the two types that matter are:

- **Radiofrequency (RF) radiation** -- produced by WiFi routers, cell phones, Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, baby monitors, and smart home devices. RF operates at higher frequencies (typically 30 MHz to 300 GHz) and is the type most people are concerned about.
- **Extremely low frequency (ELF) fields** -- produced by household wiring, power lines, and any appliance that runs on AC power. Your refrigerator, hair dryer, electric blanket, and bedside lamp all generate ELF fields when in use.

Both types decrease rapidly with distance. This is the single most important principle: **distance is your best tool.** Doubling your distance from a source reduces exposure by approximately 75%. Most of the practical steps below are applications of this principle.

## Simple Steps to Reduce Exposure

These are reasonable, low-effort changes. None of them require special equipment or major lifestyle disruption.

### WiFi and Wireless Devices

- **Turn off your WiFi router at night.** You are not using it while sleeping. A simple outlet timer can automate this -- plug the router into the timer and set it to turn off at bedtime and back on in the morning. This eliminates 6-8 hours of continuous RF exposure in your home every day.
- **Use wired ethernet connections when possible.** A wired connection to your desktop computer, smart TV, or gaming console eliminates the need for those devices to communicate via WiFi. Ethernet is also faster and more reliable.
- **Keep your phone away from your body.** Do not carry it in your pocket against your skin. Use a bag, a desk, or a table. When sleeping, do not place your phone on the nightstand next to your head -- charge it across the room or in another room entirely.
- **Use speakerphone or wired headphones for calls.** Holding the phone against your head places the antenna directly against your skull. Speakerphone, wired earbuds, or a wired headset all create distance. Note: Bluetooth headphones also emit RF, though at much lower power than a cell phone.
- **Disable WiFi and Bluetooth on devices when not in use.** Your phone, tablet, and laptop constantly scan for connections even when you are not actively using the internet. Turning off these radios when not needed reduces background RF.

### Bedroom Environment

The bedroom deserves special attention because you spend a concentrated 7-9 hours there every night.

- **Do not sleep with electronics on the nightstand.** Move your phone, tablet, and any other wireless device at least 6 feet away, or out of the room entirely.
- **Avoid electric blankets.** When plugged in, they generate ELF fields directly against your body for hours. Use wool or down blankets instead.
- **Unplug unnecessary electronics.** Alarm clocks, chargers, and other plugged-in devices generate small ELF fields. This is a low-priority item but easy to address -- unplug anything you do not actively need in the bedroom.
- **Check what is on the other side of your bedroom wall.** If your WiFi router, smart meter, or electrical panel is on the opposite side of the wall from your bed, consider moving the bed to another wall. Walls reduce RF somewhat but do not block it entirely.

### General Home

- **Position the WiFi router away from frequently occupied areas.** Do not place it in a bedroom, on a desk where you work all day, or in the living room next to the couch. A central hallway, utility closet, or high shelf in a less-used room is better.
- **Reduce the number of wireless devices.** Every smart device -- smart speakers, smart plugs, smart bulbs, wireless cameras -- adds another source of RF to your home. Ask whether each device genuinely needs to be wireless. Wired alternatives exist for many of them.
- **Maintain distance from appliances in use.** Do not stand directly in front of the microwave while it runs. Step back from the hair dryer when possible. Keep a few feet between you and the dishwasher, washing machine, or dryer during operation.

## Dirty Electricity

Dirty electricity refers to high-frequency voltage transients that ride on your home's standard 60 Hz (or 50 Hz) electrical wiring. These transients are generated by devices that convert or interrupt the electrical current -- dimmer switches, CFL and some LED bulbs, variable-speed motors, and solar inverters are common sources.

Dirty electricity filters (also called line filters or power line conditioners) plug into outlets and are designed to absorb these high-frequency transients. They are a reasonable step if you want to go further, but they are not essential for most people. Address the simpler distance-based strategies first.

If you do investigate dirty electricity, a microsurge meter (such as a Stetzerizer meter) can measure the level of high-frequency noise on your wiring and help you identify which circuits or outlets benefit most from filtering.

## Perspective: Reasonable Precautions, Not Fear

The scientific evidence on health effects of non-ionizing EMFs at household levels is not settled. Major health organizations generally consider typical home exposure levels to be safe, while some independent research suggests potential biological effects at chronic low-level exposure. The debate is ongoing.

The steps in this guide are based on the precautionary principle: where simple, low-cost actions can reduce exposure without significant lifestyle impact, it makes sense to take them. Turning off WiFi at night costs nothing. Using wired headphones is a minor habit change. Moving your phone off the nightstand takes 5 seconds.

What does not make sense is anxiety. If reducing EMF exposure causes you stress, the stress itself is likely worse for your health than the exposure. Take the easy steps, skip the ones that feel burdensome, and do not lose sleep over it -- figuratively or literally.
