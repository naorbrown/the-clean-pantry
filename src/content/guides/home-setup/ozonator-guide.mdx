## Choosing the Right Ozone Output

Ozone generators are rated by output in milligrams per hour (mg/h). Match the output to your room size to get effective results without wasting time or overdoing it.

- **Small rooms (up to 200 sq ft)** -- a unit rated at 3,500-5,000 mg/h is sufficient. Bedrooms, bathrooms, and small offices fall into this range.
- **Medium rooms (200-500 sq ft)** -- look for 5,000-10,000 mg/h. This covers most living rooms and kitchens.
- **Large open areas (500+ sq ft)** -- you need 10,000 mg/h or more. For whole-home treatment, either use a high-output unit and run it in stages (room by room) or use multiple units.

If in doubt, go slightly larger. You can always reduce the treatment time, but an undersized unit will not reach the ozone concentration needed to be effective.

## Setup Procedure

Follow these steps every time you run your ozone generator. There are no shortcuts here -- ozone is a lung irritant and must be treated with respect.

1. **Remove all people and pets from the treatment area.** This includes fish tanks, bird cages, and indoor plants. Ozone at treatment concentrations is harmful to all living things.
2. **Close all windows and doors in the treatment area.** Stuff towels under door gaps if there are large air leaks. The goal is to keep the ozone concentrated.
3. **Place the ozone generator in the center of the room**, elevated on a table or shelf if possible. Ozone is heavier than air and will settle, so raising the unit helps with distribution.
4. **Set the timer based on your situation:**
   - Mild odors (cooking smells, pet odor): 30-60 minutes
   - Moderate odors (smoke, musty smell): 1-2 hours
   - Severe contamination (mold remediation, heavy smoke damage): 2-4 hours
5. **Turn on the unit and leave the room immediately.** Do not linger.
6. **Wait at least 2 hours after the unit shuts off** before re-entering. Ozone breaks down into regular oxygen (O2) over time, but this process is not instant.
7. **Open all windows and run fans for 30 minutes** once you re-enter to flush out any remaining ozone.

## Applications

Ozone treatment is a remediation tool, not a daily air freshener. Use it for specific problems.

- **Post-renovation off-gassing** -- new paint, flooring adhesives, and composite wood products release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for weeks or months. An ozone treatment can accelerate the breakdown of these chemicals. Run a 2-hour treatment, ventilate, and repeat over several days if needed.
- **Mold remediation** -- after physically removing mold and fixing the moisture source, ozone kills remaining spores and eliminates the persistent musty odor. This is a complement to mold removal, not a substitute for it.
- **Smoke odor removal** -- cigarette smoke, fire damage, and cooking smoke embed in fabrics, walls, and carpet padding. Ozone breaks down the tar and nicotine compounds that cause the smell. Multiple treatments may be needed for heavy smoke damage.
- **Pest treatment aftermath** -- after dealing with a pest infestation, ozone can neutralize allergens, droppings residue, and chemical treatment odors.

## Regular Use Schedule

For most homes, ozone treatment is not something you do on a schedule. It is an as-needed tool. However, if you have ongoing issues like recurring musty smells in a damp basement, a monthly 1-hour treatment can help keep things under control while you work on the underlying moisture problem.

## When NOT to Use an Ozonator

- **In any occupied room.** Ever. No exceptions.
- **Near people with COPD, asthma, or other respiratory conditions.** Even residual ozone after treatment can trigger symptoms. Wait longer before allowing sensitive individuals back into a treated space -- 4 hours minimum after the unit shuts off.
- **As a substitute for cleaning.** Ozone breaks down organic compounds, but it does not remove dust, dirt, or physical debris. Clean first, then treat with ozone if needed.
- **In rooms with rubber gaskets, seals, or sensitive electronics.** Ozone degrades rubber and can corrode certain metals and electronic components over time with repeated exposure.

## Maintenance

- **Clean the ozone plates** every 3-5 uses. Wipe them gently with a damp cloth and let them dry completely before the next use. Dirty plates reduce ozone output significantly.
- **Replace ozone plates** every 2,000-3,000 hours of use, or when you notice the output has dropped even after cleaning.
- **Wipe down the unit exterior** occasionally to prevent dust buildup in the air intake vents.
- **Store in a dry location** when not in use. Humidity can damage the internal components over time.
