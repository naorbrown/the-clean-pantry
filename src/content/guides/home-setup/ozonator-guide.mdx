## Choosing the Right Ozone Output

Ozone generators are rated by output in milligrams per hour (mg/h). Match output to room size.

- **Small rooms (up to 200 sq ft)** -- 3,500-5,000 mg/h. Bedrooms, bathrooms, small offices.
- **Medium rooms (200-500 sq ft)** -- 5,000-10,000 mg/h. Living rooms, kitchens.
- **Large open areas (500+ sq ft)** -- 10,000 mg/h or more. For whole-home treatment, run one high-output unit room by room, or use multiple units.

When in doubt, size up. You can shorten treatment time, but an undersized unit won't reach effective ozone concentration.

## Setup Procedure

Follow these steps every time. Ozone is a lung irritant -- no shortcuts.

1. **Remove all people, pets, fish tanks, bird cages, and plants** from the treatment area. Ozone at treatment concentrations harms all living things.
2. **Close all windows and doors.** Stuff towels under door gaps to keep ozone concentrated.
3. **Place the generator in the center of the room**, elevated on a table or shelf. Ozone is heavier than air, so height helps distribution.
4. **Set the timer:**
   - Mild odors (cooking, pet): 30-60 minutes
   - Moderate odors (smoke, mustiness): 1-2 hours
   - Severe contamination (mold, heavy smoke): 2-4 hours
5. **Turn on and leave immediately.**
6. **Wait at least 2 hours after shutoff** before re-entering. Ozone breaks down to oxygen over time, but not instantly.
7. **Open all windows and run fans for 30 minutes** to flush remaining ozone.

## Applications

Ozone is a remediation tool, not a daily air freshener. Use it for specific problems.

- **Post-renovation off-gassing** -- accelerates VOC breakdown from new paint, flooring adhesives, and composite wood. Run 2 hours, ventilate, repeat over several days if needed.
- **Mold remediation** -- kills remaining spores and eliminates musty odor after physical mold removal. A complement to removal, not a substitute.
- **Smoke odor removal** -- breaks down tar and nicotine compounds embedded in fabrics, walls, and carpet. Multiple treatments may be needed for heavy damage.
- **Pest treatment aftermath** -- neutralizes allergens, droppings residue, and chemical treatment odors.

## Regular Use Schedule

Ozone treatment is an as-needed tool, not a scheduled routine. The exception: recurring musty smells in a damp basement benefit from a monthly 1-hour treatment while you address the underlying moisture problem.

## When NOT to Use an Ozonator

- **In any occupied room.** No exceptions.
- **Near people with respiratory conditions.** Residual ozone triggers symptoms in people with COPD or asthma. Wait 4+ hours after shutoff for sensitive individuals.
- **As a substitute for cleaning.** Ozone breaks down organic compounds but doesn't remove dust or debris. Clean first, then treat.
- **In rooms with rubber gaskets, seals, or sensitive electronics.** Ozone degrades rubber and corrodes certain metals with repeated exposure.

## Maintenance

- **Clean ozone plates** every 3-5 uses with a damp cloth. Dry completely before next use.
- **Replace plates** every 2,000-3,000 hours, or when output drops despite cleaning.
- **Wipe the exterior** occasionally to prevent dust in air intake vents.
- **Store dry.** Humidity damages internal components over time.
