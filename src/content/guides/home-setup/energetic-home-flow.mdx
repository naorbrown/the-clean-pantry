## What Energetic Flow Means

This is not about crystals or mysticism. A room with good flow has clear paths, intentional scents, and a layout that serves its purpose. A room with poor flow feels cramped or subtly wrong. The difference is usually a handful of small adjustments -- not a renovation.

## Start at the Entrance

Your front door sets the tone. Keep the entryway clean, uncluttered, and well-lit. A welcoming scent -- citrus or peppermint -- signals a fresh start each time you walk in. Remove shoes, bags, and mail that don't belong. If your entryway doubles as storage, address that first.

## Scent as a Design Tool

Scent anchors mood. Lavender for bedroom rest, peppermint for office focus, citrus for kitchen energy, eucalyptus for bathroom freshness. Reed diffusers, simmer pots, or room sprays let you zone your home by scent with no structural changes. Use the same scent family in each room so your brain associates smell with activity.

## The Furniture Flow Test

Walk through each room as a visitor. Where do you bump into things, sidestep furniture, or feel cramped? Pull furniture away from walls. Create clear paths between doorways. Let rooms breathe with enough open floor space that movement feels natural. Be honest about what blocks movement and rearrange.

## Clean Spaces Flow Better

Dust and clutter physically block airflow and mentally weigh a room down. Clutter creates decision fatigue. Clean, clear surfaces make a room feel lighter and larger even if nothing else changes. Pair cleaning days with resetting scent anchors: clean surfaces plus fresh scent creates a reset you feel immediately.

## Electronics and Energy

Electronics generate heat and attract dust. Position them where air circulates freely -- not crammed in closed cabinets or stacked together. Keep vents clean. If a corner feels stagnant or warm, check whether electronics are the cause. Adding clearance around devices makes a noticeable difference.

## Putting It Together

Pick one room -- the one that bothers you most. Clean it, rearrange for clear paths and open floor space, add one scent anchor. Live with it for a week. Then move to the next room. Small, intentional changes beat a full redesign.
