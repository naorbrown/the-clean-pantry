## Sauna Types and Their Cleaning Needs

Home saunas fall into two main categories, each with distinct maintenance requirements. Traditional (Finnish) saunas use heated rocks and water to produce steam, creating a hot and humid environment that promotes bacterial and mold growth on wood surfaces. Infrared saunas use radiant heat panels and operate at lower temperatures with minimal humidity, which reduces mold risk but still requires regular cleaning due to sweat accumulation on benches, walls, and floors.

Both types share a common trait: the combination of heat, moisture, and organic matter (sweat, dead skin cells, body oils) creates conditions where bacteria, mold, and mildew can establish quickly if cleaning is neglected.

## Safe Cleaning Materials

The interior of a sauna is almost entirely unfinished wood -- cedar, hemlock, basswood, or spruce. Unfinished wood is porous and absorbs whatever liquid you apply to it, which means your cleaning products end up embedded in the wood and released as vapor during your next session. This is why conventional cleaners have no place in a sauna.

Safe options for sauna wood surfaces include:

- **Plain water and a scrub brush.** For routine cleaning, this is often sufficient. Scrub the benches and floor with hot water and a stiff natural-bristle brush after each session to remove sweat and oils before they soak in.
- **White vinegar solution.** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. The acetic acid kills surface bacteria and mold without introducing synthetic chemicals into the wood. The vinegar smell dissipates completely when the sauna is heated for the next session.
- **Baking soda paste.** For stubborn stains or areas with visible discoloration from sweat, make a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the spot, scrub gently with a soft brush, and wipe clean. Baking soda is mildly abrasive and alkaline, which helps lift organic stains.
- **Hydrogen peroxide (3%).** For mold spots on wood surfaces, spray undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide directly on the affected area, let it sit for 10 minutes, and scrub with a brush. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen, leaving no chemical residue.

## What to Avoid

Several common cleaning products and materials are dangerous in a sauna environment:

- **Bleach and chlorine-based cleaners.** When heated, these release chlorine gas. In an enclosed sauna, even small amounts of chlorine vapor can cause respiratory distress.
- **Ammonia-based cleaners.** Like bleach, ammonia becomes volatile at sauna temperatures and produces irritating fumes.
- **Stains, sealants, and polyurethane.** Never apply any finish to sauna wood. These products off-gas formaldehyde and VOCs at elevated temperatures. Sauna wood is meant to remain unfinished.
- **Essential oils applied directly to wood.** While a few drops on the sauna rocks or in the steam water are fine, applying essential oils directly to wood surfaces can leave rancid residue that becomes foul-smelling when heated repeatedly.

## Safety Practices

Operating a home sauna safely requires attention to a few non-negotiable practices:

- **Ventilation.** Every sauna needs an intake vent near floor level and an exhaust vent near the ceiling. Proper airflow prevents carbon dioxide buildup during sessions and allows moisture to escape afterward, reducing mold risk.
- **Temperature monitoring.** Keep a dedicated sauna thermometer inside at eye level. Traditional saunas should operate between 150 and 195 degrees Fahrenheit. Infrared saunas typically operate between 120 and 150 degrees. Exceeding these ranges increases burn risk and accelerates wood degradation.
- **Hydration.** Drink at least 16 ounces of water before entering the sauna and another 16 ounces after. The body can lose a pint of sweat during a 20-minute session. Dehydration in a sauna can lead to dizziness, fainting, and heat exhaustion.
- **Session duration.** Limit sessions to 15 to 20 minutes for traditional saunas and 20 to 30 minutes for infrared saunas. Longer sessions do not provide additional health benefits and increase the risk of overheating.
- **Towel barrier.** Always sit and lie on a towel rather than directly on the wood. This absorbs sweat before it penetrates the wood grain and significantly reduces the frequency of deep cleaning needed.

## Maintenance Schedule

A consistent cleaning routine prevents problems from accumulating:

- **After every session:** Wipe down benches with a towel, leave the door open for 30 minutes to allow moisture to escape, and prop up any removable bench boards to air dry.
- **Weekly:** Scrub all wood surfaces with hot water and a brush. Spray high-contact areas (bench seats, headrests, backrests) with the vinegar solution and wipe clean.
- **Monthly:** Inspect all wood surfaces for signs of mold, mildew, or darkening. Treat any spots with hydrogen peroxide. Check the heater and rocks for debris. Sand any rough or splintered wood surfaces lightly with fine-grit sandpaper.
- **Annually:** Deep clean the entire sauna by scrubbing all surfaces, inspecting the ventilation system, and checking the heater and electrical connections for wear.
