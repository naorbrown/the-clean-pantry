## Sauna Types and Their Cleaning Needs

Home saunas fall into two categories. Traditional (Finnish) saunas use heated rocks and steam, creating humidity that promotes bacterial and mold growth on wood. Infrared saunas use radiant heat at lower temperatures with minimal humidity, reducing mold risk but still requiring regular cleaning from sweat buildup.

Both types combine heat, moisture, and organic matter (sweat, dead skin, body oils) that let bacteria, mold, and mildew establish quickly without regular cleaning.

## Safe Cleaning Materials

Sauna interiors are almost entirely unfinished wood -- cedar, hemlock, basswood, or spruce. Unfinished wood absorbs whatever you apply, embedding cleaning products that release as vapor during the next session. Conventional cleaners have no place in a sauna.

Safe options:

- **Plain water and a scrub brush.** Scrub benches and floor with hot water and a stiff natural-bristle brush after each session to remove sweat and oils before they soak in.
- **White vinegar solution.** Equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Kills surface bacteria and mold. The smell dissipates when the sauna is next heated.
- **Baking soda paste.** For stubborn stains or sweat discoloration. Apply paste, scrub gently with a soft brush, wipe clean.
- **Hydrogen peroxide (3%).** For mold spots -- spray undiluted, wait 10 minutes, scrub. Decomposes into water and oxygen, leaving no residue.

## What to Avoid


- **Bleach and chlorine-based cleaners.** Release chlorine gas when heated. Even small amounts cause respiratory distress in an enclosed sauna.
- **Ammonia-based cleaners.** Become volatile at sauna temperatures, producing irritating fumes.
- **Stains, sealants, and polyurethane.** Off-gas formaldehyde and VOCs at elevated temperatures. Sauna wood must remain unfinished.
- **Essential oils on wood surfaces.** A few drops on rocks or steam water are fine. Oil on wood leaves rancid residue that smells foul when heated repeatedly.

## Safety Practices


- **Ventilation.** Intake vent near floor, exhaust vent near ceiling. Prevents CO2 buildup during sessions and lets moisture escape afterward.
- **Temperature monitoring.** Traditional saunas: 150-195F. Infrared: 120-150F. Exceeding these increases burn risk and accelerates wood degradation.
- **Hydration.** At least 16 oz water before entering, 16 oz after. The body can lose a pint of sweat in 20 minutes.
- **Session duration.** 15-20 minutes for traditional, 20-30 for infrared. Longer sessions add risk without additional benefit.
- **Towel barrier.** Always sit on a towel. Absorbs sweat before it penetrates wood grain and reduces deep cleaning frequency.

## Maintenance Schedule


- **After every session:** Wipe benches with a towel, leave door open 30 minutes, prop up removable bench boards to air dry.
- **Weekly:** Scrub all wood with hot water and a brush. Spray high-contact areas with vinegar solution and wipe clean.
- **Monthly:** Inspect for mold, mildew, or darkening. Treat spots with hydrogen peroxide. Check heater and rocks for debris. Sand splintered wood lightly.
- **Annually:** Deep clean all surfaces, inspect ventilation, check heater and electrical connections.
