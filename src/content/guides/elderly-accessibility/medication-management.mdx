## Why Medication Management Matters

Adults over 65 take an average of 5 or more medications daily. Keeping track of multiple pills, dosages, and schedules is a real challenge -- and mistakes can have serious health consequences. A simple, consistent system for organizing, storing, timing, and disposing of medications eliminates most of the confusion and risk.

## Organizing Medications

A clear organization system is the foundation. Start here.

- **Use a weekly pill organizer.** A 7-day organizer with AM/PM compartments is the simplest way to manage a daily medication schedule. Fill it at the same time each week (Sunday evenings work well for most people).
- **Fill from the original bottles.** When loading the organizer, work from the prescription bottles, not from memory. Cross-reference each bottle with the current medication list.
- **Keep a master medication list.** Write down every medication, the dosage, when it is taken, and what it is for. Keep one copy on the refrigerator and one in your wallet. Bring it to every doctor's appointment.
- **Review with the pharmacist.** Ask the pharmacist to review all medications annually for interactions. This is especially important when a new medication is added.
- **Clean the organizer weekly.** Pill dust and coating residue build up in the compartments. Soak the organizer in warm water with a splash of vinegar, scrub with an old toothbrush, and air dry completely before refilling.

## Storing Medications Safely

Improper storage can make medications less effective or even harmful.

- **Avoid the bathroom.** Despite the name "medicine cabinet," bathroom humidity and temperature fluctuations degrade many medications. Store pills in a cool, dry, dark place like a bedroom drawer or kitchen cabinet away from the stove.
- **Keep medications in original containers** when possible. The original container has the prescription label, dosage instructions, and expiration date. If using a pill organizer, keep the original bottles organized nearby for reference.
- **Check expiration dates monthly.** Expired medications may be less effective or, in rare cases, chemically changed. Dispose of expired medications promptly.
- **Separate look-alike pills.** If two medications look similar, label the bottles clearly or use different colored organizer compartments to prevent mix-ups.
- **Keep out of reach of grandchildren.** If children visit, store medications in a high cabinet with a childproof latch, or in a locked drawer.

## Timing and Reminders

Consistency in timing is important for many medications.

- **Set daily alarms.** A phone alarm or a simple kitchen timer set for each dose time is the most reliable reminder system. Label each alarm with the medication name if possible.
- **Tie medications to routines.** Take morning pills with breakfast, evening pills with dinner. Connecting a pill to an existing habit makes it harder to forget.
- **Automatic pill dispensers.** For complex schedules or memory concerns, electronic pill dispensers can be programmed to open the correct compartment at the correct time and sound an alarm.
- **What to do if you miss a dose.** Never double up on the next dose. Check the medication's specific instructions (some say to take it as soon as you remember, others say to skip and take the next scheduled dose). When in doubt, call the pharmacist.

## Safe Disposal of Medications

Do not flush medications or throw them in the regular trash. Both can be harmful.

- **Drug take-back programs.** Most pharmacies and many police stations have medication drop-off bins. This is the safest disposal method.
- **At-home disposal method.** If no take-back program is available: mix the pills with something undesirable (used coffee grounds, dirt, or cat litter) in a sealed plastic bag, and place the sealed bag in the household trash.
- **Remove personal information.** Scratch out or peel off your name, address, and prescription number from the empty bottle before recycling or discarding it.
- **Never share medications.** Even if someone has similar symptoms, sharing prescription medications is dangerous and illegal. Dosages are prescribed for a specific individual based on their health profile.

## When to Ask for Help

Medication management is not a sign of weakness -- it is a safety practice. Seek help when:

- The medication schedule is too complex to manage alone.
- Doses are frequently missed or doubled.
- Side effects are causing confusion or dizziness (which increases fall risk).
- A new medication is added and the schedule needs to be reorganized.
- The person has difficulty opening bottles, reading labels, or distinguishing between pills.

A pharmacist, home health aide, or family member can help set up and maintain a medication system. The goal is a system simple enough to follow consistently every single day.
