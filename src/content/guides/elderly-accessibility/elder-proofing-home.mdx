## Why an Accessibility Audit Matters

Falls are the leading cause of injury for adults over 65. The majority of these falls happen at home, in rooms the person uses every day. An accessibility audit is a systematic walk-through of every room, identifying hazards and making changes before an accident happens. Most modifications are simple, inexpensive, and can be done in a weekend.

This guide covers each room with specific, actionable changes. Not every item will apply to every home -- focus on the rooms and modifications most relevant to the person's needs and mobility level.

## Bathroom

The bathroom is the most dangerous room in the home for falls due to wet, slippery surfaces.

- **Grab bars:** Install grab bars next to the toilet (at least one, ideally two -- one vertical, one horizontal) and inside the shower or tub. Mount them into wall studs, not just drywall. Suction cup grab bars are unreliable and should never be the primary support.
- **Non-slip mats:** Place non-slip mats or adhesive strips inside the tub and shower. Use a non-slip bath mat outside the tub where the person steps onto the floor.
- **Raised toilet seat:** If getting up from the toilet is difficult, a raised toilet seat adds 3-5 inches of height and reduces the effort needed to stand. Models with armrests provide additional support.
- **Shower chair or bench:** A shower chair eliminates the need to stand for the entire duration of a shower, reducing fatigue and fall risk.
- **Handheld showerhead:** Replaces the fixed showerhead and allows showering while seated. Most install without tools by screwing onto the existing shower arm.
- **Lighting:** Ensure the bathroom is bright. Add a nightlight with a motion sensor for nighttime trips to the bathroom.
- **Cleaning:** Use non-oily cleaners only. Vinegar and baking soda clean effectively without leaving slippery residue on any surface.

## Kitchen

The kitchen involves reaching, bending, and handling hot items -- all requiring modifications for safety.

- **Reorganize cabinets:** Move everyday items (plates, cups, frequently used food) to countertop level or the lowest shelves. Nothing regularly used should require a step stool.
- **Anti-fatigue mat:** Place a cushioned, non-slip mat in front of the sink and stove where the person stands for extended periods.
- **Lever-style faucets:** Replace round knobs with lever-handle faucets. They require much less grip strength to operate.
- **Reachable fire extinguisher:** Mount a fire extinguisher where it can be reached without climbing or bending.
- **Good lighting:** Install under-cabinet lights to illuminate countertop work areas. Good task lighting prevents cuts and burns.
- **Stable seating:** Keep a sturdy chair or stool in the kitchen so the person can sit during food preparation.

## Living Room

Furniture arrangement and flooring are the priorities here.

- **Clear pathways:** Create wide, unobstructed paths between furniture. A person using a walker needs at least 36 inches of clearance. Remove coffee tables or other low furniture from main walking paths.
- **Secure rugs:** Remove loose area rugs entirely, or secure them with double-sided carpet tape. Loose rug edges are one of the top tripping hazards.
- **Firm seating:** Ensure the primary chair or sofa has a firm seat, solid armrests, and a height that makes it easy to stand from. Very deep, soft couches are difficult to get out of.
- **Remote access:** Keep the TV remote, phone, and any other daily-use items within arm's reach of the primary seating area.
- **Lighting:** Eliminate dark corners. Use floor lamps (secured against tipping) or table lamps to provide even illumination across the room.

## Stairways

Stairs are a high-risk area that requires multiple safety measures.

- **Handrails on both sides:** If there is only one handrail, add a second. Handrails should extend the full length of the stairs and be securely mounted into studs.
- **Non-slip stair treads:** Apply adhesive non-slip treads to each step, or ensure carpet is tightly secured and not worn.
- **Lighting:** Install light switches at both the top and bottom of the stairway. Every step should be clearly visible. Consider motion-activated stair lights.
- **Contrast strips:** Apply contrasting color tape to the edge of each step so the edges are clearly visible, especially for someone with vision changes.
- **Handrail condition:** Polish wooden handrails lightly with a minimal amount of olive oil and vinegar to keep the wood smooth without making it slippery.

## Bedroom

The bedroom needs to support safe nighttime movement.

- **Bed height:** The bed should be at a height where the person can sit on the edge with feet flat on the floor and knees at roughly 90 degrees. Adjustable bed risers can raise a low bed.
- **Bed rails:** If the person has difficulty getting in or out of bed, a bed rail provides something to grip and push against.
- **Nighttime lighting:** A motion-activated nightlight between the bed and bathroom eliminates fumbling in the dark.
- **Clear floor:** Remove all clutter, cords, and loose items from the floor between the bed and the door. This path is walked in the dark and must be completely clear.
- **Phone within reach:** Keep a phone on the nightstand at all times.

## Outdoor Spaces

Entrances, porches, and walkways need attention too.

- **Walkway condition:** Repair any cracked, uneven, or heaved sidewalk or patio pavers. Fill gaps where a cane tip or walker wheel could catch.
- **Handrails at all steps:** Every exterior step, even a single step, should have a handrail.
- **Outdoor lighting:** Install motion-activated lights at all exterior doors and along walkways.
- **Non-slip surfaces:** Apply non-slip coatings or adhesive strips to wooden decks and concrete steps that become slippery when wet.
- **Seasonal hazards:** In winter, keep walkways clear of ice and snow. Use salt or sand for traction -- avoid de-icing products that damage concrete.

## Getting Started

Do not try to do everything at once. Prioritize based on risk.

1. **Start with the bathroom.** Grab bars, non-slip mats, and a raised toilet seat are the highest-impact, lowest-cost changes.
2. **Address stairways next.** Handrails, lighting, and non-slip treads prevent the most serious injuries.
3. **Clear all walkways.** Remove loose rugs, floor clutter, and electrical cords from walking paths throughout the home.
4. **Improve lighting everywhere.** Adequate lighting is the single most underrated fall prevention measure.
