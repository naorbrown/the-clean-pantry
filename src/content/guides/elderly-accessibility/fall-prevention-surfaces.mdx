## The Problem: Slippery Surfaces at Home

Slippery surfaces cause the majority of at-home falls for older adults. Wet bathroom tiles, polished hardwood, worn stair treads, and smooth outdoor concrete all become hazardous when grip is reduced. The good news is that most slippery surfaces can be treated with simple, low-cost solutions that dramatically reduce fall risk.

This guide covers every surface type in the home with specific, actionable solutions.

## Bathroom: Tubs and Showers

The bathtub and shower floor are the highest-risk surfaces in the home.

- **Adhesive non-slip strips.** Apply textured adhesive strips in parallel rows across the bottom of the tub, spaced about 2 inches apart. These provide reliable grip when wet and are available at any hardware store. Replace them when the texture wears smooth (usually every 6-12 months).
- **Non-slip bath mats (inside the tub).** A rubber mat with suction cups covers a larger area than strips. Choose one with drainage holes so water does not pool underneath. Lift the mat after each shower to prevent mold growth.
- **Clean without oils.** Use only vinegar and baking soda to clean the tub. Commercial cleaners that contain oils, silicone, or "shine" agents leave an invisible slippery film.
- **Bath mat outside the tub.** Place a non-slip absorbent mat where the person steps out of the tub. The mat should have a rubber backing that grips the floor. Wash it weekly.

## Bathroom and Kitchen Tile Floors

Ceramic and porcelain tile become slick when wet, especially glazed tiles.

- **Non-slip floor mats.** Place rubber-backed mats at the sink, in front of the toilet, and at the tub exit. Ensure they lay flat with no curled edges.
- **Anti-slip floor treatments.** Commercial non-slip coatings (applied like a mop solution) etch the tile surface microscopically, increasing grip when wet. These are available at hardware stores and last 1-3 years.
- **Wipe up water immediately.** Keep a mop or absorbent floor towel near the bathroom and kitchen to clean up splashes quickly.
- **Avoid floor wax or polish** on any tile that may get wet. Polish makes tile dangerously smooth when moisture is present.

## Hardwood Floors

Hardwood is naturally smooth and becomes slippery with socks or when waxed.

- **Remove or secure all rugs.** Throw rugs on hardwood are the number one tripping hazard. Either remove them entirely or secure every edge with double-sided carpet tape or a non-slip rug pad.
- **Non-slip socks or slippers.** Socks on hardwood are a common fall cause. Provide non-slip socks (with rubber grippy dots on the soles) or slippers with rubber soles.
- **Mop with vinegar and water only.** Vinegar and water clean hardwood without leaving a slippery residue. Avoid Murphy's Oil Soap or similar products that build up a slick film over time.
- **Do not over-polish.** If the hardwood finish is very glossy and slippery, a light scuff with a clean tennis ball on a broom handle can reduce sheen in high-traffic areas.

## Stairs

Stair falls cause the most serious injuries.

- **Non-slip stair treads.** Apply self-adhesive, textured rubber treads to each step. For carpeted stairs, ensure the carpet is tightly secured with no loose edges. Carpet that is worn, frayed, or bubbling should be replaced or removed.
- **Contrast edge strips.** Apply bright or contrasting colored tape along the edge of each step. Depth perception decreases with age, and a clearly visible step edge prevents missteps.
- **Full-length handrails.** Both sides of every stairway should have a handrail that extends the entire length plus an extra 12 inches at the top and bottom. Round handrails (1.25 to 1.5 inches in diameter) are the easiest to grip.
- **Adequate lighting.** Light switches at both the top and bottom of every stairway. Every step must be clearly visible. Motion-activated stair lights are an excellent upgrade.

## Outdoor Concrete, Stone, and Decks

Outdoor surfaces become hazardous in rain, dew, frost, or fallen leaves.

- **Non-slip deck paint or coating.** For wooden decks, use a deck paint that contains grit additives for traction. These are widely available and can be applied with a roller.
- **Anti-slip adhesive strips for steps.** Apply industrial-grade non-slip strips to the edge of every outdoor step. Choose strips rated for outdoor use -- indoor strips degrade in weather.
- **Keep surfaces clean and clear.** Wet leaves, moss, and algae are extremely slippery. Scrub outdoor surfaces regularly with vinegar and water. A stiff brush removes moss and algae effectively.
- **Address drainage.** If a walkway or patio pools water, address the grading or drainage so water flows away from walking surfaces.
- **Winter safety.** Keep walkways salted or sanded in freezing weather. Clear snow promptly. A heated walkway mat at the front door prevents ice buildup in the most critical spot.

## Lighting: The Overlooked Fall Prevention Tool

Poor lighting is a surface hazard in itself -- you cannot avoid what you cannot see.

- **60-watt equivalent LED bulbs minimum** in every room, hallway, and stairway.
- **Nightlights with motion sensors** in the bedroom, hallway, and bathroom for nighttime trips.
- **Light switches at both ends** of every hallway and stairway. If rewiring is impractical, wireless battery-operated light switches can be added to any wall.
- **Eliminate glare.** Very bright, unshielded bulbs create glare that is as disorienting as low light for aging eyes. Use frosted bulbs or lampshades to diffuse light evenly.

## Ongoing Maintenance

Surface safety is not a one-time project. Build these checks into a regular routine.

- **Monthly:** Check all non-slip strips and mats for wear. Replace anything with reduced texture.
- **Weekly:** Clean bathroom and kitchen floors with vinegar and water. Never use oil-based cleaners on any walking surface.
- **Seasonally:** Inspect outdoor surfaces for moss, algae, and ice damage. Reapply non-slip coatings as needed.
- **After any change:** If new furniture is placed, a rug is moved, or a floor is refinished, walk the full path of daily movement to check for new hazards.
