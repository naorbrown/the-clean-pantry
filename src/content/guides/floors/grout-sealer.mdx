## Why Grout Needs Sealing

Cement-based grout is porous. Without a sealer, it absorbs water, spills, dirt, and cleaning solutions. Over time this causes staining, discoloration, and mold growth deep within grout lines where surface cleaning cannot reach. Sealing fills those pores with a protective barrier that repels moisture and prevents stain penetration.

## Types of Grout Sealers

### Penetrating Sealers (Impregnating)

Absorb into the grout and fill pores from within. No change to appearance -- grout looks the same but repels water and oil.

- Best for: floors, showers, backsplashes, any area that gets wet
- Reapplication: every 1-3 years depending on traffic
- Look for: water-based, low-VOC formulas

### Topical Sealers (Coating)

Sit on the surface creating a visible film. Slight sheen with strong stain protection, but wear unevenly in high-traffic areas.

- Best for: low-traffic decorative tile, countertops
- Reapplication: every 1-2 years, with full stripping before resealing
- Less common for floors due to uneven coating wear

For most homeowners, a penetrating sealer is the better choice -- more forgiving, easier to maintain, no appearance change.

## How to Seal Grout

### Preparation

1. **Clean the grout thoroughly.** Baking soda paste on grout lines, sit 10 minutes, scrub with a stiff nylon brush. For tough stains, spray undiluted white vinegar after the baking soda and scrub while it fizzes. Rinse well.
2. **Let grout dry completely.** Sealer on damp grout will not penetrate properly. Wait 24-48 hours after wet cleaning. Use a fan in humid environments.
3. **Inspect for damage.** Repair cracked or crumbling grout before sealing. Allow new grout to cure 72+ hours before applying sealer.

### Application

1. Apply with a small foam brush or applicator wheel. Work in 3-4 square foot sections.
2. Thin, even coat directly on grout lines. Wipe sealer off tile surfaces immediately -- most sealers haze on tile if left to dry.
3. Let the first coat absorb 5-10 minutes (check product label).
4. Apply a second coat, especially in high-moisture areas like showers.
5. Allow 24-48 hours of full cure before water exposure.

## Maintaining Sealed Grout

- **Clean with mild solutions.** Warm water with a few drops of castile soap. Avoid bleach and ammonia, which degrade the sealer.
- **Wipe spills promptly.** Sealer buys time but is not permanent. Acidic spills (tomato, wine, citrus) eventually penetrate.
- **Test the seal annually.** Drop water on a grout line. If it beads, the seal is intact. If it absorbs and darkens, time to reseal.
- **Reseal every 1-3 years.** Shower grout: every 12-18 months. Dry-area floor grout: up to 3 years.

## Common Mistakes

- **Sealing dirty grout.** The sealer locks in whatever is on the surface.
- **Sealing damp grout.** Trapped moisture causes hazy sealer and poor adhesion.
- **Skipping the second coat.** One coat provides minimal protection in wet areas.
- **Using vinegar as a regular cleaner.** Excellent for occasional deep cleaning, but acidity etches cement grout over time. Use pH-neutral cleaner for routine maintenance.
