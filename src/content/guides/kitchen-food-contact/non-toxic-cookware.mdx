## Why Cookware Materials Matter

Cookware contacts food at high temperatures, and certain materials leach chemicals depending on temperature, food acidity, and surface condition. Scratched coatings release far more than intact ones. Choosing the right material eliminates this concern.

## Safest Cookware Materials

### Cast Iron

A well-seasoned cast iron pan develops a natural nonstick layer from polymerized oil. It leaches small amounts of dietary iron (generally considered a benefit). Heats unevenly but retains heat well -- ideal for searing, frying, and baking.

Enameled cast iron adds a glass-like coating that prevents iron leaching and is non-reactive to acidic foods.

### Stainless Steel

High-quality stainless steel (18/10 or 18/8 grade) is non-reactive and does not leach at meaningful levels. Not nonstick, but preheating and adequate fat prevent most sticking. Choose pans with an aluminum or copper core for better heat distribution.

### Pure Ceramic

100% ceramic (not ceramic-coated metal) is completely inert at any temperature. Naturally nonstick when cared for. Tradeoff: fragile -- cracks from drops or rapid temperature changes.

### Glass

Borosilicate glass (Pyrex) is chemically inert and ideal for baking. No leaching, even with acidic foods.

## Materials to Be Cautious About

### Traditional Nonstick (PTFE)

PTFE (Teflon) breaks down above 500F, releasing fumes toxic to pet birds and causing flu-like symptoms in humans. Scratched coatings release microplastics. If you use PTFE: never preheat empty, keep heat at medium, replace at first sign of wear.

### Aluminum

Uncoated aluminum leaches into acidic or salty foods. Anodized aluminum has a hardened oxide layer that significantly reduces leaching. Avoid cooking tomato, citrus, or vinegar dishes in uncoated aluminum.

### Copper

Unlined copper is toxic on food contact. Most copper cookware is lined with stainless steel or tin -- safe while the lining is intact. Retire pans with visible wear-through to copper.

## What to Look For When Buying

- **Certifications**: Prop 65 compliance and FDA food-contact approval.
- **Construction**: Heavier pans perform better and last longer. Avoid thin pans that warp.
- **No mystery coatings**: If the manufacturer won't disclose the nonstick material, skip it.
- **Handle attachment**: Riveted handles outlast spot-welded. Ensure stainless steel rivets.

## Practical Recommendations

Starter set: 10-inch cast iron skillet, 3-quart stainless steel saucepan, 6-quart enameled Dutch oven, and a glass baking dish. Covers the vast majority of cooking tasks.
