## Why Your Cutting Board Material Matters

Knife cuts create grooves where bacteria hide, and board material determines how easy they are to clean. Some boards contain adhesives, coatings, or dyes that transfer to food.

## Best Cutting Board Materials

### Solid Hardwood

Maple, walnut, cherry, and teak are the gold standard. Tight grain resists deep cuts and is naturally antimicrobial -- bacteria die in wood grain within hours, while they survive on plastic much longer.

Look for single-piece or edge-grain/end-grain construction with food-safe wood glue (Type III PVA). Avoid polyurethane, lacquer, or varnish finishes -- they chip into food.

### Bamboo

Harder than most hardwoods -- dulls knives faster but resists scoring. The concern is adhesive used to laminate strips. Look for formaldehyde-free ("E0" or "CARB Phase 2").

### Rubber (Natural or Synthetic)

Commercial-grade rubber boards (Sani-Tuff) are gentle on knives, self-healing, and easy to sanitize. Ensure food-safe and BPA-free labeling. Heavy and expensive but extremely durable.

## Materials to Avoid

### Plastic (HDPE and Polypropylene)

Cheap and dishwasher-safe, but deep knife scars harbor bacteria and shed microplastics. Replace as soon as visible knife marks accumulate.

### Glass and Ceramic

Non-porous and easy to sanitize, but destroy knife edges instantly. Food slides on the hard surface.

### Composite Boards with Unknown Materials

Compressed wood fiber and resin boards may contain formaldehyde or melamine. If materials aren't clearly stated, choose a different board.

## How to Maintain a Wood Board

1. **Season before first use.** Coat entire board (top, bottom, sides) with food-grade mineral oil. Soak overnight. Repeat 2-3 times.
2. **Re-oil monthly** when wood looks dry or lighter. Prevents cracking.
3. **Never soak in water.** Wash quickly with hot soapy water, dry immediately.
4. **Never dishwasher.** Heat and water exposure split the board.

## Natural Sanitizing Methods

- **Vinegar spray**: Undiluted white vinegar, sit 5 minutes, rinse. Kills most kitchen bacteria.
- **Salt scrub**: Coarse salt rubbed with half a lemon. Salt scrubs, citric acid disinfects.
- **Hydrogen peroxide**: 3% solution after soap-and-water cleaning. Effective against E. coli and Salmonella.

## When to Replace

Replace when deep grooves can't be sanded out, stains persist despite cleaning, or warping causes rocking. A warped board shifts while cutting -- a safety hazard.
