## Why Food Storage Materials Matter

Food storage containers contact your food for hours to weeks. Temperature changes, acidic foods, and washing accelerate chemical leaching from certain materials.

## Best Materials for Food Storage

### Glass

Glass is completely inert -- no leaching regardless of temperature, acidity, or duration. Borosilicate glass (Pyrex) handles temperature swings best. Microwave-safe (without lid), dishwasher-safe. Only downside: weight and breakability.

### Stainless Steel

Lightweight, indestructible, and non-reactive. Excellent for lunches, dry goods, and freezer. Cannot microwave. Choose food-grade 304 (18/8) stainless.

### Food-Grade Silicone

Flexible, unbreakable, and stable from -40F to 450F. Good for freezer storage and sous vide. Look for "platinum-cured" or "medical grade" -- cleaner process, no residue. Avoid peroxide-cured silicone (noticeable odor).

## Materials to Avoid

### Plastic Containers (Especially Old Ones)

Plastic leaches chemicals when heated, scratched, or used with acidic or fatty foods.

- **BPA** replacements (BPS, BPF) may carry similar risks. "BPA-free" does not mean safe.
- **Phthalates** migrate into fatty foods.
- **Microplastics** shed from scratched containers.

At minimum: never microwave in plastic, skip the dishwasher, replace scratched or warped containers.

### Styrofoam

Styrofoam leaches styrene (probable carcinogen) into hot and fatty food. Transfer takeout to glass or ceramic before microwaving.

### Aluminum Foil in Direct Contact

Aluminum foil leaches into acidic foods. Use parchment paper as a barrier, or switch to glass containers.

## Smart Transition Strategy

1. **Start with hot food containers.** Replace plastic used for reheating -- leaching is worst here.
2. **Next, fatty and acidic foods.** Oily dressings and tomato sauce pull more chemicals from plastic.
3. **Keep plastic for dry goods only.** Lowest-risk use case.
4. **Buy 3-4 glass containers with lids** in different sizes for daily use.

## Care and Maintenance

- Inspect glass for chips or cracks before heating.
- Wash silicone in hot soapy water or dishwasher. Bake empty at 350F for 10 minutes to remove lingering odor.
- Wipe stainless steel water spots with a vinegar-dampened cloth.
