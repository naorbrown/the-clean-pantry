## Essential Oils Are Not Harmless

Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts. A single drop of peppermint oil is equivalent to roughly 28 cups of peppermint tea. This concentration is what makes them effective, but it is also what makes them potentially dangerous when misused. Just because something is natural does not mean it is safe in every context.

## Oils That Are Toxic to Cats

Cats lack a liver enzyme (glucuronyl transferase) that metabolizes many compounds found in essential oils. This means that oils which are safe for humans can build up to toxic levels in a cat's system. The following oils should never be diffused, applied, or left accessible in homes with cats:

- **Tea tree (melaleuca)** -- even small amounts can cause tremors, coordination loss, and liver failure
- **Eucalyptus** -- causes drooling, vomiting, and respiratory distress
- **Peppermint** -- can cause liver damage and breathing difficulties
- **Cinnamon** -- irritates mucous membranes and can damage the liver
- **Citrus oils (lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit)** -- contain limonene, which cats cannot process
- **Pine and fir** -- contain phenols that are toxic to cats
- **Clove** -- contains eugenol, which is hepatotoxic to cats
- **Wintergreen** -- contains methyl salicylate, dangerous to cats even in trace amounts

If your cat shows drooling, vomiting, difficulty breathing, tremors, or lethargy after exposure to any essential oil, contact your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center immediately.

## Oils That Are Generally Safe Around Dogs

Dogs are less sensitive than cats but can still be affected by certain oils. The following are generally considered safe to diffuse around dogs in well-ventilated spaces:

- Lavender
- Chamomile
- Frankincense
- Cedarwood
- Ginger

Oils to avoid around dogs include tea tree (toxic at ingestion levels), pennyroyal (extremely toxic), and wintergreen. Always keep oils stored where dogs cannot access them, and never apply undiluted essential oils directly to a dog's skin or fur.

## Child Safety

Children are more sensitive to essential oils than adults due to their smaller body weight, developing organ systems, and thinner skin.

**Age guidelines for diffusing:**

- **Under 3 months** -- do not diffuse any essential oils around infants this young.
- **3 months to 2 years** -- only lavender and chamomile, diffused in a well-ventilated room for no more than 30 minutes, with the child at a distance from the diffuser.
- **2 to 6 years** -- lavender, chamomile, frankincense, and sweet orange are generally safe. Use 1-2 drops in the diffuser. Avoid peppermint, eucalyptus, and rosemary, which contain compounds (1,8-cineole and camphor) that can cause breathing problems in young children.
- **6 years and older** -- most common oils are safe when diffused in moderation. Introduce new oils one at a time and watch for reactions.

**Topical application on children** should always use heavy dilution -- 0.5% to 1% concentration (1-2 drops per tablespoon of carrier oil). Never apply undiluted essential oils to a child's skin. Keep all essential oils stored out of reach.

## Never Ingest Essential Oils

Despite what some multi-level marketing companies claim, essential oils should not be taken internally without the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional trained specifically in aromatic medicine. Essential oils can burn mucous membranes, damage the esophagus, interact with medications, and cause liver or kidney damage. Adding essential oils to water does not make them safe to drink -- oil and water do not mix, so the undiluted oil contacts tissue directly.

## Diffuser Safety

Diffusing is the safest way to enjoy essential oils, but it still requires common sense:

- **Do not diffuse in small, enclosed rooms** without ventilation. A bathroom with the door closed is not an appropriate diffusing space.
- **Limit diffusing sessions to 30-60 minutes** with breaks in between. Continuous diffusing for hours oversaturates the air and increases the risk of headaches, nausea, and respiratory irritation.
- **Use the correct amount of oil.** Most diffusers need only 3-5 drops. More is not better -- it simply makes the concentration too high.
- **Place diffusers out of reach** of children and pets, on a stable surface, away from the edge of tables and counters.
- **Clean your diffuser regularly.** Oil residue builds up and can harbor bacteria or mold in the water reservoir.

## Quality Indicators

Not all essential oils are created equal. Low-quality oils may be adulterated with synthetic fragrance compounds, carrier oils, or cheaper essential oils. Here is how to identify quality:

- **GC/MS testing** -- reputable companies provide Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry test results for each batch, confirming the oil's chemical composition and purity. This is the single most important quality indicator.
- **Latin botanical name on label** -- the label should state the exact species (for example, Lavandula angustifolia, not just "lavender").
- **"Fragrance oil" is not essential oil** -- if the label says "fragrance," "perfume oil," or "nature-identical oil," it is synthetic. These should never be used in diffusers intended for therapeutic purposes.
- **Price as indicator** -- if rose or neroli oil costs the same as lavender, something is wrong. Genuine essential oils vary widely in price based on how much plant material is required to produce them.
- **Dark glass bottles** -- quality oils are sold in amber or cobalt blue glass to protect against UV degradation. Clear bottles or plastic containers suggest a lower-quality product.
