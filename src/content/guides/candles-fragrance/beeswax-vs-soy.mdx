## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Beeswax | Soy | Paraffin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source | Honeybee hives | Soybean oil | Petroleum refining |
| Toxins when burned | None known | None known | Toluene, benzene, VOCs |
| Burn time | Longest | Moderate | Shortest |
| Scent throw | Mild natural honey | Good with added oils | Strongest |
| Soot production | Very low | Low | High |
| Cost per candle | Highest | Moderate | Lowest |
| Renewable | Yes | Yes | No |

## Beeswax

Beeswax is a natural wax produced by honeybees to build honeycomb. It is the oldest candle-making material known and remains one of the cleanest options available.

**Health and air quality.** Beeswax candles produce virtually no soot when properly wicked and trimmed. They release negative ions when burned, which can help neutralize pollutants, allergens, and dust in the air. This is the same principle behind commercial ionizing air purifiers, though on a smaller scale. Beeswax does not release toxic chemicals when burned.

**Burn characteristics.** Beeswax has the highest melting point of any natural wax (around 145 degrees F), which means it burns slower and lasts significantly longer than soy or paraffin candles of the same size. A beeswax candle can last 2-5 times longer than a paraffin candle.

**Scent.** Pure beeswax has a subtle, natural honey scent that many people find pleasant on its own. It does not hold added fragrance as aggressively as soy or paraffin, so if you want a strongly scented candle, beeswax may not be the best choice. It does accept essential oils, but the scent throw will be lighter.

**Cost.** Beeswax is the most expensive candle wax because it takes approximately 6-7 pounds of honey for bees to produce one pound of wax. Expect to pay 2-3 times more for a beeswax candle compared to soy, and 4-5 times more compared to paraffin.

## Soy Wax

Soy wax is made from hydrogenated soybean oil. It became popular in the 1990s as a plant-based alternative to paraffin.

**Health and air quality.** Soy candles burn cleaner than paraffin with minimal soot and no known toxic emissions. They are a solid middle ground between the premium quality of beeswax and the affordability of paraffin, without the health concerns.

**Burn characteristics.** Soy wax burns at a lower temperature than beeswax, which results in a moderate burn time. It melts into a liquid pool evenly across the surface, which helps it release fragrance efficiently.

**Scent.** Soy wax holds fragrance oils very well and produces good scent throw -- the ability to fill a room with fragrance. This makes it the preferred wax for scented candle makers who want a clean-burning candle that still delivers strong aroma.

**Cost.** Soy wax is more affordable than beeswax but more expensive than paraffin. A soy candle typically costs 30-50% more than a comparable paraffin candle.

**Considerations.** Look for 100% soy wax. Many candles marketed as "soy" are actually soy-paraffin blends, which undermines the health benefits. Check the label carefully.

## Paraffin Wax

Paraffin is a petroleum byproduct and the most widely used candle wax in the world, primarily because of its low cost and excellent scent throw.

**Health and air quality.** Paraffin is the worst option for indoor air quality. When burned, it releases toluene, benzene, and other volatile organic compounds. It produces significantly more soot than either beeswax or soy. See our [guide on toxic candles](../toxic-candles) for detailed information on the health concerns.

**Burn characteristics.** Paraffin has the shortest burn time of the three waxes. It burns hotter and faster, consuming the wax more quickly.

**Scent.** Paraffin holds fragrance oils better than any other wax and produces the strongest scent throw. This is why most heavily scented commercial candles use paraffin -- it is simply the best carrier for synthetic fragrance.

**Cost.** Paraffin is by far the cheapest candle wax, which is why it dominates the mass-market candle industry.

## Other Wax Options

**Coconut wax** is a newer option made from the meat of coconuts. It burns cleanly, holds fragrance well, and has a smooth, creamy appearance. It is often blended with soy or beeswax for improved structure since it is very soft on its own. It is more expensive than soy but comparable in performance.

**Palm wax** produces a distinctive crystalline finish and burns cleanly. However, palm oil production is a major driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia, so sustainability is a significant concern. If you choose palm wax, look for RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) certification.

## Bottom Line

For health and air quality, beeswax is the clear winner. If cost is a factor or you want stronger scent throw, soy wax is an excellent compromise. Avoid paraffin whenever possible -- the health tradeoffs are not worth the savings.
