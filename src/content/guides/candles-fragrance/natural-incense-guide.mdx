## What's in Commercial Incense

Most incense sold in convenience stores, gift shops, and online marketplaces is made from a base of charcoal dust and sawdust bound together with synthetic adhesives. The fragrance comes from synthetic fragrance oils -- laboratory-created chemical compounds designed to mimic natural scents at a fraction of the cost. A single "sandalwood" synthetic fragrance oil may contain dozens of individual chemicals, none of which come from an actual sandalwood tree.

Common ingredients in commercial incense include:

| Component | Purpose | Concern |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Charcoal dust | Burns hot and fast to carry fragrance | Produces heavy soot and particulate matter |
| Sawdust filler | Cheap bulk material | Often from treated lumber containing formaldehyde |
| Synthetic fragrance oils | Scent | May contain phthalates, synthetic musks, and undisclosed VOCs |
| DPG (dipropylene glycol) | Fragrance solvent and fixative | Produces acrolein when burned, a respiratory irritant |
| Potassium nitrate (saltpeter) | Accelerant to keep the stick lit | Increases combustion temperature and smoke output |
| Synthetic dyes | Color | Some release toxic fumes when burned |

The term "fragrance" on an incense label -- just like on candles and cleaning products -- is a catch-all that can represent a proprietary blend of hundreds of chemicals. Manufacturers are not required to disclose individual fragrance components.

## Health Concerns

Burning any organic material produces particulate matter and combustion byproducts, and incense is no exception. But the health risks are significantly amplified by synthetic ingredients.

**Particulate matter.** Incense smoke contains fine particles (PM2.5) that penetrate deep into the lungs. Studies have measured PM2.5 concentrations from burning incense at levels that exceed WHO air quality guidelines within 30 minutes in a typical room. Charcoal-based incense produces substantially more particulate matter than plant-based alternatives because charcoal burns hotter and less completely.

**Volatile organic compounds.** Research published in environmental health journals has identified benzene, toluene, xylene, and formaldehyde in the smoke of synthetic incense. These are recognized carcinogens and respiratory irritants. The concentrations vary by brand, but cheap, heavily fragranced sticks consistently produce the highest levels.

**Carbon monoxide.** Burning multiple sticks in a poorly ventilated room can raise carbon monoxide levels measurably. This is a greater concern in small spaces like bedrooms and bathrooms.

**Respiratory effects.** Long-term, regular incense use has been associated with increased rates of asthma, chronic cough, and upper respiratory inflammation in epidemiological studies across several countries where daily incense burning is culturally common.

None of this means you should never burn incense. It means the quality of the incense matters enormously, and ventilation is non-negotiable.

## What Makes Natural Incense Different

Natural incense contains only plant-derived materials: ground wood, powdered herbs, tree resins, and plant-based binders. There are no synthetic fragrance oils, no charcoal, no chemical accelerants, and no DPG.

The key ingredient in most natural incense is **makko powder** (also called tabu no ki), ground from the bark of the Machilus thunbergii tree. Makko serves as both a binder and a natural combustion aid. Its cellulose fibers hold the incense together and sustain a slow, even burn without the need for charcoal or saltpeter. Because makko burns at a lower temperature than charcoal, more of the delicate aromatic compounds from the herbs and resins survive the combustion process intact, producing a cleaner, more nuanced scent with less smoke.

Natural incense gets its fragrance from the actual plant materials it contains. If it smells like sandalwood, it contains sandalwood. If it smells like frankincense, it contains frankincense resin. The fragrance is inherent to the ingredients, not sprayed on afterward.

The result is incense that produces noticeably less smoke, less soot, fewer particulate emissions, and no synthetic chemical byproducts. It also smells fundamentally different from commercial incense -- subtler, more complex, and closer to the experience of smelling the raw plant materials directly.

## How to Read Incense Labels

The label is your best tool for evaluating incense quality. Here is what to look for:

**Green flags:**
- Ingredients list that names specific plants, resins, or woods (sandalwood, frankincense, cedarwood, lavender, etc.)
- "Makko" or "tabu no ki" listed as binder
- "No charcoal," "no synthetic fragrance," or "all-natural" claims backed by a real ingredient list
- Country-specific traditions known for natural production (Japanese incense makers, small-batch artisan producers)

**Red flags:**
- "Fragrance" or "fragrance oil" listed as an ingredient without further detail
- No ingredient list at all
- Extremely strong scent before burning -- natural incense has a mild, earthy smell when unlit
- Very low price for large quantities (natural ingredients cost significantly more than synthetic ones)
- Bright, unnatural colors (vivid pink, electric blue, neon green)
- Incense that produces thick, heavy smoke and leaves black soot residue

If a brand does not disclose ingredients, assume it contains synthetic fragrance and charcoal. Reputable natural incense makers are proud of their ingredients and list them prominently.

## Safe Burning Practices

Even with the cleanest natural incense, proper burning habits matter:

- **Ventilate.** Always burn incense in a room with at least one open window or active ventilation. A cracked window on the opposite side of the room from the incense creates a gentle cross-draft that carries smoke out while allowing you to enjoy the fragrance.
- **Never sleep with burning incense.** Even if a stick is almost finished, extinguish it before bed. Aside from the fire risk of an unattended ember, prolonged particulate exposure in a closed bedroom while sleeping is the worst-case scenario for respiratory health.
- **Use an ash catcher.** Incense ash is hot enough to damage surfaces and can be a fire hazard on paper, fabric, or wood. Use a dedicated ceramic, stone, or metal incense holder that catches all fallen ash.
- **One stick at a time.** Burning multiple sticks simultaneously multiplies the particulate load without proportionally increasing the fragrance. One good-quality stick is enough for a standard room.
- **Limit duration.** Burn for 20-30 minutes to scent a room, then extinguish by pressing the ember tip into sand or a ceramic dish. You do not need to burn the entire stick.
- **Keep away from smoke detectors.** Not because you should disable them, but because placing incense directly below a detector guarantees false alarms. Burn at least 10 feet away from detectors.

## Types of Natural Incense

Natural incense comes in several distinct forms, each with its own character:

**Sticks (senko/agarbatti).** The most familiar form. Japanese-style sticks (senko) are typically coreless -- the entire stick is compressed aromatic powder and makko. Indian-style sticks (agarbatti) are rolled onto a thin bamboo core. Coreless sticks produce slightly less smoke because there is no bamboo burning alongside the aromatics.

**Cones.** Compressed cones of powdered aromatics and makko. They burn faster and produce more concentrated smoke than sticks because the burning surface area increases as the cone widens toward its base. Good for quickly scenting a space.

**Coils.** Spiral-shaped incense that burns for 2-4 hours. Common in Japanese and Chinese traditions. Useful for sustained, low-level fragrance during meditation or long work sessions. Hang from a metal stand or place flat on a heat-safe dish.

**Loose resin on charcoal.** The oldest method of burning incense. Raw tree resins (frankincense, myrrh, copal, benzoin) are placed on a burning charcoal disc. The charcoal provides the heat, and the resin melts and vaporizes, releasing thick, aromatic smoke. This produces the most smoke of any method and requires a dedicated heat-safe burner with sand. The experience is rich and dramatic -- closest to how incense was used for thousands of years in temples and ceremonies.

**Smudge bundles.** Tied bundles of dried herbs (sage, rosemary, cedar, lavender) that smolder when lit. Technically a form of incense, though culturally distinct. They produce a different character of smoke -- herbal and green rather than woody and resinous.

## Choosing a Style

For daily home use with minimal smoke, Japanese-style coreless sticks are the best starting point. They burn cleanly, produce subtle fragrance, and leave minimal residue. For meditation or intentional practice, loose resin on charcoal creates the most immersive aromatic experience. For a quick room refresh, cones deliver concentrated scent in 15-20 minutes. And for anyone who wants to make their own, hand-rolled sticks and pressed cones using makko powder are surprisingly simple to produce at home with nothing more than a bowl, some water, and powdered aromatics.
