## A Realistic Starting Point

There is no chemical-free way to keep a pool or hot tub sanitary. Some sanitizer is necessary. The goal is to minimize chemical use through better practices and supplementary systems -- not eliminate sanitizers entirely.

## Reducing Chlorine Demand

Chlorine demand is tied to organic load -- leaves, body oils, sunscreen, sweat, debris. Reduce the load, reduce the chemicals.

### Practical Steps

- **Shower before swimming.** Removes sunscreen, sweat, and oils that form chloramines -- the real cause of "pool smell" and eye irritation.
- **Use a pool cover.** Reduces UV chlorine degradation by ~50% and blocks debris.
- **Run skimmer and filter regularly.** Removes organics before they react with sanitizer.
- **Trim overhanging vegetation.** Leaves, pollen, and droppings add organic load.

## Supplementary Sanitizing Systems

These work alongside reduced chlorine or bromine, not as replacements.

### UV-C Sanitizers

UV-C units in the plumbing loop destroy bacteria, viruses, and algae by damaging DNA. Reduces chlorine needs 50-70%. Still requires 0.5-1.0 ppm residual chlorine since UV only treats water passing through the unit.

### Ozone Generators

Ozone (O3) destroys organic contaminants and pathogens. Breaks down quickly, so residual chlorine is still needed. Reduces chlorine use 60-90% in well-maintained pools.

### Mineral Sanitizers

Copper and silver ions inhibit algae and kill bacteria, allowing chlorine reduction to 0.5 ppm. Monitor copper levels -- excess causes green staining and can tint hair.

## Hot Tub Specifics

Higher temperature, smaller volume, and more bathers per gallon make hot tubs harder to sanitize.

- **Drain and refill every 3-4 months.** Simplest way to reset water chemistry.
- **Use bromine over chlorine.** More effective at hot tub temperatures and pH levels.
- **Add enzyme treatments weekly.** Break down oils and organics, reducing sanitizer workload.
- **Keep the cover on.** Retains heat and blocks debris.

## Water Testing

Test at least twice per week:

- **Sanitizer level** (chlorine, bromine, or mineral concentration)
- **pH** (7.2-7.6 pools, 7.2-7.8 hot tubs)
- **Total alkalinity** (80-120 ppm)

Use drop-based test kits over strips for accuracy. Proper pH and alkalinity make sanitizer work more efficiently.

## What to Avoid

- **Hydrogen peroxide as primary sanitizer.** Degrades too quickly in sunlight for safe residual levels.
- **"Chlorine-free" saltwater claims.** Saltwater pools generate chlorine via electrolysis. They are chlorine pools.
- **Colloidal silver or copper sulfate alone.** Neither meets health department kill-rate standards.
