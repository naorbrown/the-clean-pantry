## The Foundation: Healthy Soil

A healthy lawn starts underground. Most lawn problems -- thin grass, weeds, disease -- trace back to poor soil. Before spending money on any product, get a soil test. Your local agricultural extension office typically offers soil testing for under $20. The results tell you your soil's pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter content, which is the information you need to make targeted improvements instead of guessing.

Most lawn grasses prefer a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If your soil is too acidic, apply pelletized lime in fall. If it is too alkaline, apply elemental sulfur. Both are natural minerals. Follow the rates on the soil test report, not the bag label, since the correct amount depends on your starting pH and soil type.

## Natural Fertilization

### Compost Topdressing

The single most effective natural lawn treatment is a thin layer of finished compost spread over the grass once or twice per year. Apply 1/4 to 1/2 inch of fine, screened compost in early fall or spring. Use a shovel to scatter it, then drag a leaf rake or a piece of chain-link fence across the lawn to work it down to the soil surface. The compost feeds soil microbes, improves water retention in sandy soils, improves drainage in clay soils, and provides a slow-release source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

### Grass Clippings

Stop bagging your clippings. A mulching mower chops clippings finely enough that they fall between the grass blades and decompose within a week. This returns roughly 25% of the nitrogen your lawn needs each year. Leaving clippings does not cause thatch -- that is a persistent myth. Thatch is caused by a buildup of stems and roots, not leaf blades.

### Corn Gluten Meal

Corn gluten meal is a natural byproduct of corn processing that serves double duty as a pre-emergent weed preventer and a slow-release nitrogen source (10% nitrogen by weight). Apply it in early spring before soil temperatures reach 55 degrees Fahrenheit, which is when crabgrass and other annual weeds germinate. It works by inhibiting root formation in germinating seeds. It does not affect established plants, so it will not harm existing grass.

## Weed Management Without Herbicides

The best weed control is a dense, healthy lawn. Thick turf crowds out weeds by outcompeting them for light, water, and nutrients. Specific strategies include:

- **Mow high.** Set your mower to 3-4 inches. Taller grass shades the soil, which prevents weed seeds from getting the light they need to germinate. This single change eliminates more weeds than any product.
- **Overseed thin areas.** In early fall, spread grass seed over bare or thin patches. Fall seeding gives grass a full cool season to establish before summer heat and weed pressure arrive.
- **Hand-pull persistent weeds.** A stand-up weed puller makes this practical even for larger lawns. Pull weeds after rain when the soil is soft and you can extract the entire root.
- **Spot-treat with vinegar.** Horticultural vinegar (20% acetic acid, much stronger than kitchen vinegar) kills the foliage of broadleaf weeds on contact. Apply it only on the target weed, as it will also kill grass it touches. This is a top-kill method -- deep-rooted perennial weeds like dandelions may require repeat applications.

## Watering Practices

- **Water deeply and infrequently.** Apply 1 inch of water once per week rather than light daily watering. Deep watering encourages roots to grow deeper into the soil, making the lawn more drought-resistant.
- **Water early in the morning** (before 10 AM). This reduces evaporation loss and gives the grass blades time to dry before evening, which reduces fungal disease risk.
- **Use the tuna can test.** Place several empty tuna cans across your lawn and run the sprinkler. Time how long it takes to fill them to 1 inch. That is your watering duration.

## Seasonal Calendar

- **Early spring**: Apply corn gluten meal. Begin mowing when grass reaches 4 inches.
- **Late spring**: Mow regularly at 3-4 inches. Water as needed.
- **Summer**: Raise mowing height to 4 inches in heat. Water deeply once per week. Let the lawn go dormant (brown) during drought -- it will recover.
- **Early fall**: Aerate compacted areas with a core aerator. Overseed thin spots. Apply compost topdressing.
- **Late fall**: Continue mowing until growth stops. Apply lime or sulfur if the soil test indicated a need. Leave fallen leaves mulched on the lawn -- they break down over winter and feed the soil.
