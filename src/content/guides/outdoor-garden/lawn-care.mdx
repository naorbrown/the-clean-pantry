## The Foundation: Healthy Soil

Most lawn problems trace back to poor soil. Get a soil test from your local extension office (~$20) before spending money on products. Results show pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter.

Most grasses prefer pH 6.0-7.0. Too acidic: apply lime in fall. Too alkaline: apply elemental sulfur. Follow soil test rates, not bag labels.

## Natural Fertilization

### Compost Topdressing

Spread 1/4 to 1/2 inch of screened compost in early fall or spring. Scatter with a shovel, then drag a rake across the lawn to work it down. Compost feeds soil microbes, improves water retention in sandy soils, drainage in clay, and provides slow-release NPK.

### Grass Clippings

Stop bagging clippings. A mulching mower chops them fine enough to decompose within a week, returning ~25% of the nitrogen your lawn needs. Clippings do not cause thatch -- that's from stems and roots, not leaf blades.

### Corn Gluten Meal

Corn gluten meal is a pre-emergent weed preventer and slow-release nitrogen source (10% N). Apply early spring before soil hits 55F. Inhibits root formation in germinating seeds without affecting established grass.

## Weed Management Without Herbicides

Dense, healthy turf is the best weed control.

- **Mow high (3-4 inches).** Taller grass shades soil, preventing weed germination. Most impactful single change.
- **Overseed thin areas in early fall.** Gives grass a full cool season to establish.
- **Hand-pull after rain** when soil is soft and roots extract completely.
- **Spot-treat with horticultural vinegar (20% acetic acid).** Kills broadleaf weed foliage on contact. Also kills grass it touches -- apply only on target. Repeat for deep-rooted perennials.

## Watering Practices

- **Water deeply and infrequently.** 1 inch per week encourages deeper roots and drought resistance.
- **Water before 10 AM.** Reduces evaporation and lets blades dry before evening, lowering fungal risk.
- **Tuna can test.** Place cans across the lawn, run sprinkler, time to 1 inch. That's your watering duration.

## Seasonal Calendar

- **Early spring**: Corn gluten meal. Begin mowing at 4 inches.
- **Late spring**: Mow at 3-4 inches. Water as needed.
- **Summer**: Mow at 4 inches. Water deeply weekly. Let lawn go dormant in drought -- it recovers.
- **Early fall**: Core aerate compacted areas. Overseed thin spots. Compost topdress.
- **Late fall**: Mow until growth stops. Apply lime/sulfur per soil test. Mulch fallen leaves on the lawn.
