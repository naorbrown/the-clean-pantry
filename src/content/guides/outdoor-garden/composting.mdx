## Why Compost

Composting converts kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment. Diverts 30-40% of household waste from landfill, reduces need for synthetic fertilizers, and improves soil structure.

## The Two Ingredients: Browns and Greens

Composting is about balancing two categories:

### Browns (Carbon-Rich)

Dry leaves, cardboard (torn small), newspaper, straw, wood chips, sawdust (untreated only). Provide carbon for microbial energy and air pockets for oxygen flow.

### Greens (Nitrogen-Rich)

Fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags (remove staples), grass clippings, plant trimmings, crushed eggshells. Provide nitrogen for microbial growth.

### The Ratio

3 parts brown to 1 part green by volume (C:N ratio ~25-30:1). Too much green = slimy and smelly. Too much brown = slow decomposition.

## Getting Started

### Choose a Location

Place on bare soil in partial shade. Direct soil contact lets worms migrate in. Shade prevents summer drying. Choose a convenient location -- too far from the kitchen and you won't use it.

### Build the Pile

1. 4-6 inch coarse browns on the bottom for drainage.
2. 2-3 inch layer of greens.
3. 6-8 inch layer of browns.
4. Alternate layers, finish with browns on top (reduces odor, discourages flies).
5. Moisten each layer -- target wrung-out sponge dampness.

### Minimum Size

Minimum size: 3x3x3 feet (1 cubic yard) to retain heat for efficient decomposition. Smaller piles work but decompose more slowly.

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Turning

Turn with a pitchfork every 1-2 weeks. Oxygen keeps aerobic bacteria active. Without it, anaerobic bacteria produce foul odors. Move outside material to the center where temperatures peak.

### Moisture

Check weekly. Dry: add water while turning. Too wet: mix in dry browns. Overly wet piles become compacted and anaerobic.

### Temperature

An active pile feels warm in the center. Peak temperatures (130-160F) kill weed seeds and pathogens. Not heating? Add more greens or moisture.

## What Not to Compost

- **Meat, fish, bones, dairy.** Attract rodents, create strong odors.
- **Cooking oils and grease.** Block microbial access, slow decomposition.
- **Pet waste (dog/cat).** Pathogens survive home composting temperatures.
- **Diseased plants.** Fungal spores and bacteria can reinfect your garden.
- **Treated or painted wood.** Chemical treatments persist and contaminate soil.
- **Weeds gone to seed.** Seeds survive unless pile consistently reaches 150F+.

## When Is It Done?

Finished compost is dark, crumbly, and smells like earth -- no recognizable materials. Takes 3-6 months with turning, 6-12 months without.

## Using Finished Compost

- **Garden beds**: Work 2-3 inches into the top 6 inches of soil.
- **Lawn topdressing**: 1/4 inch of screened compost in fall.
- **Container plants**: Mix 1:3 with potting soil. Pure compost suffocates roots.
- **Mulch**: 2-3 inches around trees, shrubs, and perennials.
