## Why Compost

Composting converts kitchen scraps and yard waste into a nutrient-rich soil amendment. A well-managed compost pile diverts 30-40% of a typical household's waste from the landfill, reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, improves soil structure, and supports beneficial soil microorganisms. Finished compost is the single best thing you can add to garden soil.

## The Two Ingredients: Browns and Greens

All composting comes down to balancing two categories of organic material:

### Browns (Carbon-Rich)

Dry leaves, cardboard (torn into small pieces), newspaper (uncoated), straw, wood chips, sawdust (untreated wood only), and dryer lint from natural-fiber clothing. Browns provide the carbon that soil microbes use as an energy source. They also create air pockets in the pile that allow oxygen to circulate.

### Greens (Nitrogen-Rich)

Fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds and filters, tea bags (remove staples), fresh grass clippings, plant trimmings, and crushed eggshells. Greens provide the nitrogen that microbes need to build proteins and reproduce.

### The Ratio

Aim for roughly 3 parts brown to 1 part green by volume. This provides the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (about 25-30:1) that compost microbes work fastest at. Too much green material creates a slimy, smelly pile. Too much brown material slows decomposition to a crawl.

## Getting Started

### Choose a Location

Place your compost pile or bin on bare soil in a spot with partial shade. Direct soil contact allows worms and beneficial organisms to migrate into the pile from below. Partial shade prevents the pile from drying out too quickly in summer. Choose a convenient location -- if it is too far from your kitchen, you will be less likely to use it consistently.

### Build the Pile

1. Start with a 4-6 inch layer of coarse browns (small sticks, wood chips) at the bottom for drainage and airflow.
2. Add a layer of greens about 2-3 inches thick.
3. Add a layer of browns about 6-8 inches thick.
4. Continue alternating layers, finishing with a brown layer on top. The brown top layer reduces odors and discourages fruit flies.
5. Moisten each layer as you build. The pile should feel like a wrung-out sponge -- damp but not dripping.

### Minimum Size

A compost pile needs a minimum volume of roughly 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet (1 cubic yard) to generate and retain enough heat for efficient decomposition. Smaller piles work but decompose more slowly because they cannot sustain the thermophilic (high-heat) temperatures that break down material quickly.

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Turning

Turn the pile with a pitchfork every 1-2 weeks. Turning introduces oxygen, which the aerobic bacteria need to decompose material efficiently. Without oxygen, anaerobic bacteria take over, producing foul odors (hydrogen sulfide, ammonia) and slowing the process. Move material from the outside of the pile to the center, where temperatures are highest.

### Moisture

Check moisture weekly. If the pile is dry, add water as you turn. If it is too wet (usually from too many greens or heavy rain), mix in dry browns. An overly wet pile becomes compacted and anaerobic.

### Temperature

An active compost pile should feel warm to the touch in the center. Peak temperatures of 130-160 degrees Fahrenheit kill weed seeds and pathogens. If your pile is not heating up, it likely needs more greens (nitrogen) or more moisture. You can buy a compost thermometer for under $15 to track this.

## What Not to Compost

- **Meat, fish, bones, and dairy.** These attract rodents and raccoons and create strong odors. They do break down eventually but are best left to municipal composting facilities that reach higher temperatures.
- **Cooking oils and grease.** Coat organic matter and prevent microbial access, slowing decomposition.
- **Pet waste (dog and cat).** May contain parasites and pathogens that home compost piles do not reach high enough temperatures to destroy.
- **Diseased plants.** Fungal spores and bacterial pathogens can survive composting and reinfect your garden.
- **Treated or painted wood.** Chemical treatments (CCA, creosote) persist in compost and contaminate soil.
- **Weeds that have gone to seed.** Unless your pile consistently reaches 150+ degrees Fahrenheit, the seeds may survive and spread when you use the compost.

## When Is It Done?

Finished compost is dark brown or black, crumbly, and smells like earth. You should not be able to identify any of the original materials. Most backyard piles reach this stage in 3-6 months with regular turning, or 6-12 months without turning. If you can still see recognizable food scraps or leaves, the compost needs more time.

## Using Finished Compost

- **Garden beds**: Work 2-3 inches of compost into the top 6 inches of soil before planting.
- **Lawn topdressing**: Spread a thin layer (1/4 inch) of screened compost over the lawn in fall.
- **Container plants**: Mix compost with potting soil at a 1:3 ratio. Do not use pure compost in containers -- it retains too much moisture and can suffocate roots.
- **Mulch**: Spread compost 2-3 inches thick around trees, shrubs, and perennials to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.
