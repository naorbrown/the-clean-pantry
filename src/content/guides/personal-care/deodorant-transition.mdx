## Why There Is an Adjustment Period

Commercial antiperspirants plug sweat glands with aluminum compounds. When you stop, suppressed glands resume normal function and your skin's bacterial ecosystem shifts. This transition lasts one to four weeks.

You may notice increased sweating and stronger odor. This is normal and temporary -- your body is adjusting to a new equilibrium, not "detoxing."

## Week-by-Week Expectations

**Week 1:** The most noticeable phase. More sweating, stronger odor as your skin bacteria change. The bacteria that thrive under antiperspirant differ from those on naturally perspiring skin.

**Week 2:** Sweating begins to regulate. Odor may still be above baseline, but many people notice improvement by week's end.

**Weeks 3-4:** Body has largely adjusted. Sweat stabilizes, the new bacterial ecosystem produces less odor. Natural deodorant works as intended from here.

## Strategies for the Transition

### Timing

Start during a vacation, work-from-home week, or cooler weather. Not before a job interview or wedding.

### Hygiene Adjustments

- **Wash underarms twice daily** during the first two weeks with castile soap
- **Apply to clean, fully dry skin.** Moisture prevents adhesion and dilutes active ingredients
- **Reapply midday if needed.** Keep a small amount at your desk or in your bag

### Baking Soda Sensitivity

Many natural deodorants use baking soda as the primary odor neutralizer. Its alkaline pH (8-9) causes irritation or rash in some people, especially after shaving. This is pH disruption, not an allergic reaction.

If this happens:

- Switch to a formula using magnesium hydroxide, arrowroot, or zinc oxide
- Wait at least 30 minutes after shaving before applying any deodorant
- Apply a thin layer of coconut oil first as a buffer

### The Armpit Mask (Optional)

Mix 1 tablespoon bentonite clay with 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar. Apply to clean underarms for 10-15 minutes, then rinse. Draws out old antiperspirant residue. Not necessary, but may speed adjustment.

## Choosing the Right Natural Deodorant

Three main formulation types:

- **Baking soda-based:** Most effective for odor. Risk of irritation for sensitive skin.
- **Magnesium-based:** Gentler, effective for mild to moderate odor. Best for sensitive skin.
- **Probiotic-based:** Beneficial bacteria outcompete odor-causing strains. Less predictable.

All three rely on moisture absorption (arrowroot or cornstarch) and antibacterial agents (coconut oil, tea tree, or zinc). None stop sweating -- they manage its consequences.

## When It Is Not Working

After four weeks of significant odor, try a different formulation before giving up. Skin chemistry varies. Switch between baking soda, magnesium, and probiotic types, giving each at least two weeks.

If excessive sweating (not odor) is the concern, consult a dermatologist about hyperhidrosis.
