## Why Regular Bed Cleaning Matters

Pet beds accumulate dead skin cells, saliva, body oils, shed fur, and outdoor dirt. Within a week of use, a pet bed can harbor dust mites, bacteria, and in some cases flea eggs and larvae. A 2018 study found that pet beds are one of the top ten germiest surfaces in the average home. Regular cleaning reduces allergens for both pets and humans, prevents flea populations from establishing in bedding fibers, and keeps odors from permeating your home.

## Washing Schedule

- **Weekly**: Remove and wash the bed cover or liner if the bed has one.
- **Bi-weekly**: Wash the entire bed (insert and cover) if it fits in your machine, or spot clean and deodorize the insert.
- **Monthly**: Deep clean the full bed, inspect for wear, and treat with a deodorizer.

## How to Machine Wash a Pet Bed

Most pet beds with removable covers can go in a standard washing machine. Check the care label first, then follow these steps:

1. Remove the cover and shake it outside to dislodge loose fur and debris.
2. Pre-treat any visible stains by rubbing a paste of baking soda and water into the stain and letting it sit for 15 minutes.
3. Wash on a warm or hot cycle (hot kills dust mites). Use an unscented, plant-based laundry detergent -- fragrance additives and optical brighteners can irritate pet skin.
4. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle. The vinegar acts as a natural fabric softener, deodorizer, and helps remove detergent residue.
5. Dry on medium heat in the dryer, or air dry in direct sunlight. Sunlight is a natural disinfectant -- UV rays kill bacteria and help eliminate odors.

## Hand Washing and Spot Cleaning

For beds that are too large for your machine or do not have removable covers:

1. Vacuum the bed thoroughly on both sides to remove fur, dander, and dust mite waste.
2. Fill a bathtub or large basin with warm water and 2 tablespoons of unscented castile soap.
3. Submerge the bed and agitate by hand for several minutes, squeezing the water through the filling.
4. Drain and refill with clean water. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar during this rinse. Repeat rinsing until the water runs clear.
5. Squeeze out excess water (do not wring, which damages filling) and dry flat in the sun or near a fan.

## Natural Deodorizing Between Washes

Between full washes, keep the bed smelling fresh with a simple baking soda treatment:

1. Remove the pet bed to an outdoor area or a room with good ventilation.
2. Sprinkle a generous layer of baking soda over the entire surface.
3. Let it sit for 30-60 minutes. The baking soda absorbs oils and neutralizes odor compounds.
4. Vacuum thoroughly, making multiple passes to remove all the baking soda from the fabric.

This method is safe for all pets and contains no fragrances, essential oils, or chemicals.

## Dealing with Fleas in Bedding

If you find fleas or flea dirt (small dark specks that turn red when wet) in your pet's bed:

1. Wash the bed immediately in the hottest water the fabric can tolerate. Heat above 130 degrees Fahrenheit kills fleas at all life stages.
2. Dry on the highest dryer setting for at least 30 minutes.
3. Vacuum the area around where the bed was sitting, including nearby carpet and baseboards.
4. Repeat the wash cycle in 3-4 days to catch any eggs that may have survived.
5. Treat your pet with a veterinarian-recommended flea treatment simultaneously. Cleaning the bed alone will not solve an active infestation.

## Choosing a Bed That Is Easy to Clean

When shopping for a new pet bed, prioritize these features for easier natural maintenance:

- **Removable, machine-washable cover.** This is the single most important feature for keeping a bed clean.
- **Tightly woven outer fabric.** Loose weaves trap more fur and are harder to vacuum clean.
- **Waterproof inner liner.** Prevents moisture, oils, and odors from soaking into the filling material.
- **Synthetic filling over foam.** Polyester fiberfill dries faster and tolerates repeated washing better than memory foam, which retains moisture and can develop mold if not dried completely.
