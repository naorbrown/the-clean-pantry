## Why Regular Bed Cleaning Matters

Pet beds accumulate skin cells, saliva, oils, fur, and dirt. Within a week, they harbor dust mites, bacteria, and potentially flea eggs. Regular cleaning reduces allergens, prevents flea populations, and controls odors.

## Washing Schedule

- **Weekly**: Remove and wash the bed cover or liner if the bed has one.
- **Bi-weekly**: Wash the entire bed (insert and cover) if it fits in your machine, or spot clean and deodorize the insert.
- **Monthly**: Deep clean the full bed, inspect for wear, and treat with a deodorizer.

## How to Machine Wash a Pet Bed

1. Remove cover and shake outside to dislodge fur.
2. Pre-treat stains with baking soda paste, sit 15 minutes.
3. Wash hot (kills dust mites). Use unscented, plant-based detergent.
4. Add 1/2 cup white vinegar to the rinse cycle as deodorizer and softener.
5. Dry on medium heat or air dry in sunlight (UV kills bacteria).

## Hand Washing and Spot Cleaning

For beds too large for machines or without removable covers:

1. Vacuum thoroughly on both sides.
2. Fill tub with warm water and 2 tbsp unscented castile soap.
3. Submerge and agitate by hand, squeezing water through filling.
4. Rinse with 1/2 cup vinegar until water runs clear.
5. Squeeze (don't wring) excess water. Dry flat in sun or near a fan.

## Natural Deodorizing Between Washes

1. Move bed to a ventilated area.
2. Sprinkle generous baking soda over the surface.
3. Sit 30-60 minutes to absorb oils and neutralize odors.
4. Vacuum thoroughly with multiple passes.

Safe for all pets -- no fragrances, essential oils, or chemicals.

## Dealing with Fleas in Bedding

1. Wash immediately in hottest water tolerated. Heat above 130F kills fleas at all stages.
2. Dry on highest setting for 30+ minutes.
3. Vacuum the surrounding area including carpet and baseboards.
4. Repeat wash in 3-4 days to catch surviving eggs.
5. Treat your pet simultaneously -- cleaning the bed alone won't solve an infestation.

## Choosing a Bed That Is Easy to Clean

- **Removable, machine-washable cover.** Most important feature.
- **Tightly woven outer fabric.** Traps less fur, easier to vacuum.
- **Waterproof inner liner.** Keeps moisture and odors out of the filling.
- **Synthetic filling over foam.** Dries faster, tolerates repeated washing. Memory foam retains moisture and risks mold.
