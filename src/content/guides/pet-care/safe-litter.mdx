## Why Litter Choice Matters

Conventional clay litters contain sodium bentonite (expands 15x when wet, irritating when inhaled as dust) and sometimes crystalline silica dust (IARC-classified carcinogen in fine particulate form). Cats groom their paws after using the box, ingesting whatever clings to their fur.

## Natural Litter Options

### Paper-Based Litter

Recycled newspaper pressed into pellets. Virtually dust-free -- best for cats with asthma. Absorbs well but doesn't clump; change entire box every 5-7 days. Moderate odor control, lightweight, biodegradable.

### Wood-Based Litter

Pine pellets suppress ammonia odors naturally. When wet, pellets break to sawdust -- easy to spot what needs scooping. Some cats dislike pellet texture. Cedar can trigger allergic reactions; pine is the safer wood choice.

### Corn and Wheat Litters

Clump naturally from starch content -- closest alternative to clumping clay. Flushable in small amounts (check local codes). Can develop mold if too damp or attract insects in humidity. Store sealed.

### Walnut Shell Litter

Excellent clumping and odor control. Dark color makes urine inspection harder. Tracks less than clay but more than pellets. Biodegradable and compostable (non-edible gardens only).

### Grass Seed Litter

Clumps well, low dust, lightweight, highly biodegradable. Main drawback: significantly more expensive per pound.

## What to Avoid

- **Scented litters.** Artificial fragrance irritates cats' respiratory systems. Clean more often instead.
- **Crystal/silica gel litters.** Silica dust risk; beads harmful if ingested by kittens.
- **Clumping clay with kittens.** Young kittens may ingest it, causing intestinal blockages.

## Transitioning to a New Litter

Transition over 7-10 days: start with 25% new, 75% old, increase gradually. If your cat stops using the box, slow down. Some cats accept immediately; others need the full period.

## Maintenance Tips

- Scoop solid waste daily regardless of litter type.
- Non-clumping litters: replace entire box every 5-7 days.
- Wash box with hot water and unscented castile soap every 1-2 weeks. No bleach or ammonia.
- One box per cat, plus one extra.
